      <p>
        An Australian trade mark attorney represents and advises clients
        regarding trade mark matters, such as{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-search">trade mark searches</Link>,{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-application">filing</Link>, registration,
        preparation of assignment documents, and enforcement in Australia and
        overseas, including{' '}
        <Link href="/international-trade-mark-application">
          international applications
        </Link>{' '}
        in target foreign markets and global applications through the{' '}
        <Link href="/madrid-protocol-application">Madrid protocol</Link>. Unlike
        patent applications, trade mark applications can be filed by anyone;
        however, registration as a trade mark attorney grants certain benefits,
        such as the right to be called a &quot;trade mark attorney&quot; or
        &quot;trade mark agent&quot; and conduct business as so.
      </p>
      <h2>Qualifications of a trade mark attorney</h2>
      <p>
        To become a registered trade mark attorney and be listed in the official
        Australian Register of Trade Mark Attorneys, the individual must possess
        several competencies in accordance to the standards set by the
        Professional Standards Board of Trade Mark and Patent Attorneys
        (hereafter referred to as the Board), who regulates registrations into
        the profession and provides disciplinary control. The requirements
        include the following:
      </p>
      <h3>Academic qualifications</h3>
      <p>To become a trade mark attorney, one must have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a Level 5 Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) qualification
          (Diploma level) or higher; or
        </li>
        <li>
          an overseas qualification that the Board deems equivalent to a Level 5
          AQF qualification
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While it is not a requirement, a degree in law may be beneficial in the
        practise of trade marks attorneys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowledge on other forms of intellectual property, such as patents,
        copyright, design, trade practises, domain names, circuit layout, plant
        breeder&apos;s rights, and confidential information are similarly
        advantageous.
      </p>
      <h3>Knowledge qualifications</h3>
      <p>
        The IP curriculum includes nine topic groups, but the following four
        course groups are sufficient to be eligible to practise as a trade mark
        attorney.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Legal process and overview of intellectual property</li>
        <li>Professional conduct</li>
        <li>Trade marks law</li>
        <li>Trade marks practice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Knowledge requirements can be obtained by enrolling in accredited
        courses offered by several prescribed tertiary institutions or applying
        for exemptions to the Board on the basis of having previously taken the
        equivalents of these topics.
      </p>
      <h3>Personal qualifications</h3>
      <p>
        A trade mark attorney is tasked to function according to law and act in
        the best interest of their client. Thus, it is of utmost importance that
        trade mark attorney be
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>of good fame, integrity, and character;</li>
        <li>
          not convicted for a prescribed offence for the last five years; and
        </li>
        <li>not sentenced to imprisonment for a prescribed offence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Finally, the trade mark attorney should be an ordinary Australian
        citizen.
      </p>
      <h2>Takeaway/s</h2>
      <p>
        A person must have a spotless character, sufficient technical knowledge,
        and the complete educational requirements to be able to become an
        Australian trade mark attorney. Even so, the field is starting to become
        extremely competitive with applicants having identical or similar
        qualifications, so differences in experience and work environment may
        spell your success or failure in the field.

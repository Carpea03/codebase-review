        complaint submitted to{' '}
        <Link

        to counter the registration of a trade mark. However, other types of
        oppositions can be filed to stop other requests made to IP Australia.
      </p>

      <h2>Opposing an extension of time of more than three months</h2>

      <p>
        Owing to commercial or strategic reasons, a party may oppose an
        extension of time of more than 3 months requested by another party.
        There are provisions for this under section 224 of the{' '}
        <em>Trade Marks Act 1995</em>.
      </p>

      <p>Common reasons for opposing an extension include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The other party has already been granted a sufficient amount of time
          to address the issues in their application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your position may become disadvantageous if such an extension is
          granted.
        </li>
        <li>
          The other party has provided insufficient justification for the time
          extension.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In order to oppose a request for time extension beyond three months, the
        opponent must submit a notice of intention to oppose within one month of
        advertising the request for extension in the Australian Official Journal
        of Trade Marks and paying the corresponding opposition fee ($250 per
        trade mark).
      </p>

      <h2>Opposing an amendment to a trade mark application</h2>

      <p>
        Similarly, you may oppose a request to change a trade mark application
        according to section 65A of the <em>Trade Marks Act 1995</em> if you
        consider that the <Link href="/trade-mark-amendment">amendment</Link>{' '}
        will affect your trade mark rights.
      </p>

      <p>
        To oppose an amendment to a trade mark application after the
        advertisement of the details, you will need to file a notice of
        intention to oppose within one month of the request being published in
        the official trade mark journal and pay the corresponding fee.
      </p>

      <h2>Opposing removal applications for non-use</h2>

      <p>
        Trade mark registrations may be removed if it is no longer used by the
        registered owner. Non-use removal action is one of the common approaches
        for trade mark applicants to address conflicting prior registrations. As
        a trade mark owner, you may defend your registration by opposing the
        non-use application.
      </p>

      <h3>Intention to Oppose</h3>

      <p>
        To oppose an application for removal of a trade mark registration, the
        registered owner can file a Notice of Intention to Oppose, followed by a
        Statement of Goods and Particulars. If no opposition is filed or the
        owner fails to file a Statement of Grounds and Particulars (SoGP), the
        registration will be removed.
      </p>

      <h3>Intention to Defend</h3>

      <p>
        If an opposition is initiated, to pursue the non-use application, the
        removal applicant may file a Notice of Intention to Defend within 1
        month from the date of receiving the SoGP filed by the owner. Failure to
        file a NID will result in the registration remaining on the register.
      </p>

      <h3>Evidence in Support</h3>

      <p>
        If the removal applicant files a NID, the opponent must file Evidence in
        Support (EIS) in support of the grounds of the opposition. If EIS is not
        filed, Opposition fails and registration will be removed.
      </p>

      <h3>Evidence in Answer</h3>

      <p>
        If EIS is filed by the opponent, the removal applicant may file Evidence
        in Answer (EIA).
      </p>

      <h3>Evidence in Reply</h3>

      <p>
        If EIA is filed by the removal applicant, the opponent may file Evidence
        in Reply (EIR) in response to EIA.
      </p>

      <h3>Hearing</h3>

      <p>
        When the evidence stage ends, either party may request to be heard or
        present written submissions in order to support their case.
      </p>

      <h3>Decision</h3>

      <p>
        The Hearing Officer decides the case based on his or her consideration
        of the evidence and submissions filed by both parties. A decision is
        made in writing and sent to both parties. The winning party may be
        awarded costs.

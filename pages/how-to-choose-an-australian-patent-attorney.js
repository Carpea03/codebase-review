      <h1>How to choose an Australian patent attorney</h1>
      <p>
        Like any other type of professional, the primary and secondary skills of
        individual patent attorneys vary, along with the capability of their
        firm. In this article, we outline 8 things to consider when choosing
        your patent attorney.
      </p>
      <h2>
        1. Choose a patent attorney who specialises in your technology area
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although many{' '}
        <Link title="Our Patent Attorneys" href="/patent-attorney">
          patent attorneys
        </Link>{' '}
        claim to be{' '}
        <Link title="IP &amp; Patent Specialisations" href="/specialisations">
          technology generalists
        </Link>
        , very few actually are. An Australian patent attorney&apos;s technology
        specialisation generally derives from a mix of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          their technical qualification (i.e. what field of engineering or
          science they studied in);
        </li>
        <li>the technology area they have been working in;</li>
        <li>the clients they have been working for;</li>
        <li>
          the areas they are personally most interested in and so read about and
          study in addition to their role; and
        </li>
        <li>how many years they have worked in your technology area.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        2. Choose an intellectual property firm that has more than 3 attorneys
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is intuitive for most clients but it&apos;s amazing how many
        inventors don&apos;t consider the downsides of working with a sole
        practitioner or small firm &ndash; they are cheaper for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst many attorneys at small firms are completely competent, it is
        extremely difficult for a small firm to operate the systems required to
        manage and update <Link href="/how-to-patent">patent</Link>,{' '}
        <Link href="/how-to-trade-mark">trade mark</Link> and{' '}
        <Link href="/registered-designs">registered design</Link> processes in
        multiple jurisdictions. The reason for this is that the processes
        involve rules and deadlines which change regularly across jurisdictions
        requiring systems to be updated. If a system is not up-to-date and a
        deadline is missed, sometimes there is no way to restore the
        intellectual property right. So it&apos;s risky to work with a firm that
        doesn&apos;t have sufficient resources to keep their systems up-to-date.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also the obvious and unfortunate risk when working with a sole
        practitioner that something might happen to them, for example they
        become ill. Most people have some serious illness at some point in their
        lives and what happens to the management of your intellectual property
        if that happens? We&apos;ve seen cases where sole practitioners have
        become ill and client rights have lapsed as a result.
      </p>
      <h2>
        3. Choose a patent attorney who can add value with their secondary
        knowledge, skills or connections
      </h2>
      <p>
        <Link title="Our Patent Attorneys" href="/patent-attorney">
          Patent attorneys
        </Link>{' '}
        often have secondary areas (aside from patents) that they are very
        knowledgeable about. For example, in our firm, we have attorneys who are
        also registered or have been registered to practice in other countries
        (e.g. USA and China). We also have attorneys who are experienced in
        licensing, commercialisation or capital raising. Remember to ask your
        attorneys which other skills or knowledge they have that might be
        helpful to your project. How else can they help you?
      </p>
      <h2>
        4. Choose a firm that can provide enforcement of your intellectual
        property
      </h2>
      <p>
        Alongside your patent attorney, it&apos;s important to have an
        experienced IP and/or commercial lawyer who can help you draft legal
        agreements and provide other legal advice. When it comes to enforcing
        your patent or defending an infringement suit, it&apos;s much easier to
        have a lawyer who already knows and has worked with your patent
        attorney. Being involved in the enforcement of patents also provides
        attorneys with a unique and helpful perspective on the drafting of
        patents, enabling them to draft more robust patent applications that can
        withstand the scrutiny applied during Court proceedings.
      </p>
      <h2>5. Choose a firm that is commercially connected</h2>
      <p>
        Some professionals work in a bit of a vacuum and they aren&apos;t very
        helpful to their clients. Other patent attorneys have extensive networks
        of corporate or capital contacts, development professionals and other
        consultants who can help you along the path to market. Whether it&apos;s
        a professional to help you with an R&amp;D tax credit or someone who can
        help you improve the industrial design of your product, why not choose
        an attorney who has the connections you need?
      </p>
      <h2>6. Choose a patent attorney who is liked by their clients</h2>
      <p>
        If the clients of a patent attorney are happy with him/her it&apos;s
        much more likely you will be too! How can you know whether the patent
        attorney you are considering has{' '}
        <Link title="Client Testimonials" href="/testimonials">
          happy clients
        </Link>
        ? Two tips:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Check the google rating of the firm &ndash; are they 4 or 5 stars?
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the net promoter score (NPS) of the firm or do they even
          measure it?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>7. Choose an IP firm that has principals who are fellows of IPTA</h2>
      <p>
        IPTA (
        <Link
          href="https://ipta.org.au/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">
          The Institute of Patent &amp; Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia
        </Link>
        ) is the professional body for patent and trade mark attorneys in
        Australia. Fellows of IPTA are normally highly regarded within the
        Australian IP profession and must have at least 5 years experience post
        registration.
      </p>
      <h2>8. Choose an IP firm that offers fixed fee pricing</h2>
      <p>
        No-one wants to work with an attorney who charges by the hour. Hourly
        charging makes it difficult to budget for your project and can easily
        lead to cost over-runs. Many firms now work on a fixed fee pricing model
        and it&apos;s definitely in your interest to consider working with one
        of them.

      <h1>Trade mark pre-filing considerations</h1>
      <p>
        Before filing a trade mark application, you need to consider the
        following questions:
      </p>
      <h2 id="types">
        What types of trade marks of your business are you applying for?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Trade marks can be business names, brand names, product names,{' '}
        <Link href="/types-of-trade-marks#composite-or-logo-trade-marks">
          logos
        </Link>
        , characters,{' '}
        <Link href="/types-of-trade-marks#colour-trade-marks">
          colour of products
        </Link>
        , the shape of products,{' '}
        <Link href="/types-of-trade-marks#scent-trade-marks">
          scents of products
        </Link>
        , among others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your trade mark attorney assists you in identifying the possible{' '}
        <Link href="/types-of-trade-marks">types of trade marks</Link> of your
        business and assessing their inherent distinctiveness.
      </p>
      <h2 id="classes">
        What classes of goods and services do you want to protect with your
        trade mark?
      </h2>
      <p>
        When filing a trade mark application, applicants need to nominate
        classes of goods and services to be claimed in an application. The{' '}
        <Link
          href="https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">
          World Intellectual Property Organisation
        </Link>{' '}
        (WIPO) divides all goods and services into{' '}
        <Link href="/classes-of-goods-and-services">45 classes</Link>. Your
        products and services are categorised into one or more classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A list of your products and/or services is helpful for your attorney to
        identify correct classes for your application and define a suitable
        scope of protection for each class.
      </p>
      <h2 id="applicant">Who is the applicant?</h2>
      <p>
        Usually, the author of the trade mark or the person who has first used
        the trade mark on relevant goods and services is entitled to{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-application">apply for a registration</Link> of
        the trade mark. The applicant should meet certain{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-pre-filing-considerations">
          eligibility requirements
        </Link>{' '}
        to be able to own a registered trade mark. The applicant of an
        application is the owner of the trade mark when it is registered.
      </p>
      <p>
        A trade mark registration obligates the owner to continuously use the
        trade mark in the course of trade. Accordingly, the owner of a trade
        mark registration determines the legislative user of the trade mark
        after registration.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it is common that the author or the first user of the trade
        mark is not going to be the ultimate user of the trade mark in trading.
        Your trade mark attorney can advise how each party should exercise its
        rights legitimately. In some cases, an assignment or a license may be
        needed.
      </p>
      <h2 id="owner">Who can own trade marks in Australia?</h2>
      <p>
        In Australia, any individual, company, incorporated association or a
        combination can own a trade mark. The applicant needs an Australia or
        New Zealand address for service. For International Registrations
        Designating Australia (IRDAs), which are submitted by foreign entities
        through the{' '}
        <Link href="/madrid-protocol-application">Madrid Protocol</Link>, the
        address of service is that of the agent acting on behalf of the
        applicant, that is, a{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-attorney">trade mark attorney</Link> or
        solicitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the applicant must not be a trade or business name, and the
        name should be that of the person as reflected in the business
        registration. A trust can own a trade mark, but the applicant should
        indicate the name of the trustee and not the trust name. For trade marks
        owned by corporations, the applicant should be the corporation name and
        not the directors or shareholders.
      </p>
      <h2 id="conflicts">
        Are there any conflicting registrations or applications?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Conflicting registrations and applications are one of the most common
        barriers which prevent an application from progressing to registration.
        Pre-filing <Link href="/trade-mark-search">trade mark searches</Link>{' '}
        can effectively identify conflicts and your trade mark attorney will be
        able to advise you around strategies on avoiding or addressing the
        conflicts.
      </p>
      <h3 id="prefiling-search">What is a pre-filing search?</h3>
      <p>
        A trade mark search may be conducted by the applicant without any
        further expenditure. However, performing a trade mark search without any
        knowledge of the available resources and the specialised knowledge
        required in performing an accurate search of similar trade marks that
        might exist on the register can result in the applicant having a false
        sense of security. These risks can be avoided by engaging a{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-attorney">registered trade mark attorney</Link>{' '}
        to perform a trade mark search.
      </p>
      <h2 id="costs">How much will the trade mark registration cost?</h2>
      <p>
        The cost of registering a trade mark will depend largely on the number
        of{' '}
        <Link href="/classes-of-goods-and-services">
          goods and/or service classes
        </Link>{' '}
        that the trade mark is to be registered under. The cost increases
        proportionally with the number of classes that the trade mark is filed
        under. The benefit of including additional classes is that the trade
        mark will cover a wider range of goods and/or services which may be
        important if the trade mark is to be used in association with a wide
        range of goods and/or services.
      </p>
      <h3 id="tm-headstart">TM Headstart</h3>

          TM Headstart

        is a pre-application service that includes pre-assessment of a trade
        mark application (conducted by trade mark examiners at{' '}

        ) before proceeding to a standard filing, with the permission of the
        applicant. While additional cost is incurred, this service provides the
        applicant with registrability information within 5 working days,
        reducing the uncertainty involved when filing the trade mark
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, a different cost structure applies when the application
        proceeds immediately to filing according to the applicant&apos;s choice
        or in cases where the TM Headstart is not applicable, such as when
        filing{' '}

      <h1>The role of Australian patent attorneys</h1>
      <p>
        An Australian patent attorney is a person who represents a patent
        applicant or patent owner before IP Australia and other bodies and is
        specially qualified to do so.{' '}

        >
          Australian patent attorneys

        can help clients file, prosecute (e.g. handle the patent examination
        process) and maintain{' '}

        </Link>{' '}
        as well as act for clients in patent oppositions and provide patent
        validity and infringement advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Registration as a patent attorney in Australia is administered by the
        Professional Standards Board for Patents and Trade Marks Attorneys. The
        Professional Standard Board publishes a Code of Conduct and administers
        the disciplinary regime for all patent attorneys in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Australian patent attorneys are fellows or ordinary members of the
        Institute of Patent &amp; Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia, the
        professional body governing the patent attorney profession in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patent attorneys have a right of privilege in their communication with
        clients in respect of intellectual property matters.
      </p>

      <h2>Australian patent attorney qualifications</h2>

      <p>
        Patent attorneys generally must have both an engineering or science
        degree and have completed a group of topics prescribed by the
        Professional Standards Board. This group of topics may take the form of
        a Masters degree, such as the Master of Industrial Property offered by
        the University of Technology, Sydney.

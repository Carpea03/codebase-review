      <h1>Trade mark enforcement and defence</h1>
      <p>
        The value of your IP is normally directly related to the extent to which
        the owner of the intellectual property rights can enforce these rights.
        Effective trade mark enforcement is necessary to maintain the value of
        your IP in legal terms and to provide an ongoing deterrent to{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-infringement">infringement</Link> by any third
        party.
      </p>
      <h2>Enforce your trade mark rights</h2>
      <p>
        Infringement is the unauthorised use of a registered trade mark. A
        registered trade mark is infringed if a sign that is substantially
        identical or{' '}
        <Link href="/ip-glossary#deceptively-similar">deceptively similar</Link>{' '}
        to a registered trade mark is used. As a trade mark owner, it is
        important to monitor the market to identify any third party selling
        their{' '}
        <Link href="/classes-of-goods-and-services">goods and services</Link>{' '}
        under your trade mark.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe your trade mark is being infringed by a third party, it
        is highly advisable to get into contact with a registered{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-attorney">trade mark attorney</Link> before
        commencing any communication with the alleged infringer.
      </p>
      <h2>Trade mark enforcement in Australia</h2>
      <h3>Qualifying infringement</h3>
      <p>
        Another party could be benefiting from your brand and reputation by
        using a sign as a trade mark that is substantially identical or
        deceptively similar to your trade mark. Trade mark enforcement against
        parties infringing your own registered mark can be addressed either in
        or out of the courts. In order to establish legal action against a
        potential infringer, you will need to prove the validity of your IP
        rights by providing evidence of the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Your trade mark is registered and in force. Intellectual property
          rights have expiry dates and in the case of trade marks, the
          registration needs to be kept up to date. Moreover, the trade mark
          should be actively used in trade.
        </li>
        <li>You are the owner of the trade mark.</li>
        <li>
          Another party is actually infringing on your trade mark. This needs to
          be established because if proven groundless, the accuser in trade mark
          infringement cases can be ordered by the courts to pay for damages
          incurred by the accused party.
        </li>
        <li>
          The infringing party does not have authority to use your trade mark.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>When can you initiate action against trade mark infringement?</h4>
      <p>
        Subject to any agreement between the owner of a registered trade mark
        and an authorised user of the trade mark, the authorised user may bring
        an action for infringement of the trade mark:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>at any time, with the consent of the registered owner; or</li>
        <li>
          during the prescribed period, if the registered owner refuses to bring
          such an action on a particular occasion during the prescribed period;
          or
        </li>
        <li>
          after the end of the prescribed period, if the registered owner has
          failed to bring such an action during the prescribed period.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If the authorised user brings an action for infringement of the trade
        mark, the authorised user must make the registered owner of the trade
        mark a defendant in the action. However, the registered owner is not
        liable for costs if he or she does not take part in the proceedings.
      </p>
      <h4>Trade Marks Act</h4>
      <p>
        The Trade Marks Act provides protection for registered trade marks.
        Establishing registration is straightforward because a registered trade
        mark will be entered into the Register of Trade Marks.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it is often more difficult to prove and more costly, some
        protection is accorded to unregistered trade marks. The tort of passing
        off and consumer protection legislation provide avenues for business
        owners to protect their trade marks from unauthorised use.
      </p>
      <h4>Passing off</h4>
      <p>
        In the Common Law tort of passing off, a party makes unauthorised use of
        a get-up, namely, the overall packaging, external appearance, or feel of
        a product, to profit from another product&apos;s established reputation.
        Registration of a trade mark is not necessary in passing off cases. The
        elements of passing off are more difficult to establish and generally
        require:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>establishment of a reputation or goodwill,</li>
        <li>
          there has been a misrepresentation that good/services of one trader
          are connected with the goods/services of another trader, and
        </li>
        <li>there has been damage to (the Plaintiff&apos;s) goodwill.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Passing off and trade mark infringement cases frequently overlap but are
        addressed using different approaches. Compared with infringement,
        passing off is not covered in any statutory sanction, and is instead
        ruled based on precedent cases tried in the pertinent courts.
      </p>
      <p>
        A successful passing off claim can result in an injunction with the
        possibility of the court also awarding damages in certain cases.
      </p>
      <h4>Misleading and Deceptive Conduct</h4>
      <p>
        Section 18 of the <em>Australian Consumer Law (ACL)</em> provides that a
        person must not engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or
        that is likely to mislead or deceive. The main focus of this provision
        is consumer protection. Therefore, the conduct will be analysed
        differently to how it would in a passing-off claim and a determination
        will have to be made on whether the use of a particular get-up or name
        is likely to mislead and deceive consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is common to see cases where there is an overlap of passing-off and
        misleading and deceptive conduct. Since the actions can be related and
        often also overlap with claims of trade mark infringement, it will be
        always advisable to have a IP specialist lawyer analyse your situation.
      </p>
      <h4>Prior use</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to the above defences, Section 124 of the Act states that
        infringement is not established when your unregistered trade mark
        relating to goods and services in question has been used continuously
        before the filing date (priority date) of the infringed trade mark or
        the first time that the infringing party or their predecessor started
        using their unregistered trade mark, whichever is earlier.
      </p>
      <h4>Pre-commencement of infringement</h4>
      <p>
        Court proceedings can be quite costly and therefore, settling disputes
        outside of court is usually preferable. Once aware of instances of
        unauthorized use of a registered Trade Mark, it is usual practice for
        the trade mark attorney to send a &quot;letter of demand&quot; to the
        infringing party. The letter of demand can be prepared in a number of
        ways depending on the objective of the Trade Mark owner. This is a
        pre-condition to commencing{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-litigation">litigation</Link> in the Federal
        Court.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mediation and arbitration may be employed so that both parties can come
        to a mutual agreement before the issue is escalated to litigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trade mark registration will protect your brand and by association, any
        reputation that you build in your{' '}
        <Link href="/choosing-a-brand-name">brand name</Link>. It has a value
        that grows with the growth of your business. If you are considering

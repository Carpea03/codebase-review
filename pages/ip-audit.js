      <h1>IP Audit</h1>
      <p>
        Despite its intangibility, intellectual property (IP) often comprises
        the largest portion of a company&apos;s overall value and in many cases
        is the most important asset a business has. All IP that a company owns
        must be accounted for in order to derive the maximum commercial
        advantage. It is important to manage the IP portfolio of a business in
        the same way as cash flow, production inventory and equipment, and the
        first step in managing IP is by identifying it. Keeping track of
        one&apos;s IP inventory through an IP audit is crucial in developing
        informed business strategies and making substantial business decisions.
        In a nutshell, the aim of an IP audit is to distill all manner of
        intangible assets, such as inventions, brands, trade dress, production
        techniques, trade secrets (e.g. formulas, methods or processes) and
        others such into measurable, valuable and manageable forms that can be
        protected and utilised for the benefit of the company.
      </p>
      <h2>What is an IP audit?</h2>
      <p>
        An IP audit is a process that involves systematically reviewing and
        listing all forms of IP that a company owns. The results of an IP audit
        help companies in a number of ways: to keep track of the status of their
        IP, identify registered IP which requires renewing, account for
        outstanding royalties receivable through licensing their IP, ensure that
        ownership and assignment of IP are properly formalised (necessary to
        maintain valid rights and for enforcement), and to compile other
        documentation required to exploit the company&apos;s IP rights. With the
        information provided by an audit, the company can determine which of the
        IP in its portfolio would provide the greatest value through licensing
        agreements, which IP may be exposed if it were to be challenged, which
        IP is most critical to protect and/or maintain for the purposes of
        enforcement, and assist with making other strategic decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through IP audits, risks or lost opportunities arising from the
        following situations can be addressed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Recognising unprotected but patentable inventions such as product
          formulations, equipment designs, production processes or product
          features;
        </li>
        <li>
          Determining which untrademarked company brands have sufficient good
          will and reputation in the market, or are otherwise so highly
          valuable, to warrant trade mark protection (and comparing such
          protection to the often weaker protection offered by the common law
          tort of passing off and Australian Consumer Law );
        </li>
        <li>
          Soon-to-lapse but renewable registered IP (e.g. patents, trade mark or
          design registrations);
        </li>
        <li>
          Unregistered but registrable and commercially valuable product
          designs;
        </li>
        <li>
          Poorly drafted employment and contractor clauses that make the
          company&apos;s IP (including trade secrets) vulnerable to competitor
          access;
        </li>
        <li>Untapped collectible licensing and franchising fees;</li>
        <li>
          Lost opportunities to commercialise the IP through licensing and
          franchising agreements; and
        </li>
        <li>Other situations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        What are the types of intellectual property identified in IP audits?
      </h2>
      <p>
        During IP audits, IP can be identified to fall under two
        classifications, namely, registered and unregistered IP rights.
        Registered IP is that which requires registration and grant to a
        governing body to be able to be defended or enforced. An application is
        submitted to the respective office in IP Australia, which then conducts
        an examination and subsequently grants or rejects the application. On
        the other hand, unregistered IP is that which automatically exists upon
        creation.
      </p>
      <p>Registered IP includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link href="/patents">Patents</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/trade-marks">Trade marks</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/registered-designs">Registered designs</Link>
        </li>
        <li>Plant breeder&apos;s rights</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unregistered IP includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copyright</li>
        <li>Circuit layout rights</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other forms of IP, or documents managing IP, that should be identified
        in an IP audit include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trade secrets</li>
        <li>Non-disclosure/confidentiality agreements</li>
        <li>Non-competition agreements</li>
        <li>Assignment agreements</li>
        <li>Franchising agreements</li>
        <li>Technology transfer agreements</li>
        <li>Co-existence agreements</li>
        <li>Manufacture and distribution agreements</li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/types-of-trade-marks#trade-dress">Trade dress</Link> and{' '}
          <Link href="/choosing-a-brand-name">brand names</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/domain-names-and-trade-marks">Domain names</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other vital information that can be obtained when conducting IP audits
        is the ownership of all IP in the company&apos;s portfolio. Ownership of
        the intellectual property should be established and the information
        should be in order and readily available because enforcement of those IP
        rights generally depends on ownership being held by the right party.
      </p>
      <p>
        The owners of IP should be identified and may be any among the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The company and its affiliates</li>
        <li>Contractors and sub-contractors</li>
        <li>Joint owners</li>
        <li>Licensees and licensors</li>
        <li>Employees</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>When should IP audits be conducted?</h2>
      <p>
        Ideally, IP audits should be conducted regularly (e.g. every year) so
        that information is kept up to date. This is necessary for effective
        strategic planning and to optimise the company&apos;s gains from their
        IP. At the minimum, however, IP audits should be conducted in the
        following scenarios:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As part of due diligence before a significant change in the corporate
          structure, such as mergers, acquisitions, or IPOs;
        </li>
        <li>
          Before the company launches a new product or embarks on a joint
          venture;
        </li>
        <li>Before a company sets up a licensing program;</li>
        <li>Before the assignment of company IP to other entities;</li>
        <li>
          Upon the implementation of new government policy and/or substantial
          changes in existing statutory laws; and/or
        </li>
        <li>When enforcing or defending IP rights.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Who conducts an IP audit?</h2>
      <p>
        A comprehensive IP audit requires a carefully established audit team. An
        IP audit team should be composed of individuals from different
        departments of the company, such as management, research and
        development, technology, and marketing. The presence of an{' '}
        <Link href="/ip-attorney">IP attorney</Link> in the team is invaluable.
        Baxter IP, Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys can see untapped IP prospects
        in a business and the potential business opportunities arising from
        these assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        An IP audit conducted by a team without an IP attorney having a strong
        knowledge of intellectual property law, may result in missed
        opportunities for IP protection and potential revenue through licensing
        or franchising and have significant commercial or financial consequences
        in the event of IP infringement. An accountant or a bookkeeper, or
        preferably an IP valuation expert, is another critical team member who
        can help the IP attorney put a value on the IP.
      </p>
      <h3>How to conduct an IP audit</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Plan the approach to the IP audit. Define the roles of each member of
          the IP audit team, the scope of the audit, and the projected timeline.
        </li>
        <li>
          Map the routes for gathering information. Different modes of data
          gathering can be employed to obtain information for IP audits, such as
          surveys, observations, interviews, written documents of contracts and
          agreements and database searches.
        </li>
        <li>Review existing systems in place for IP protection.</li>
        <li>
          Identify and list all IP in a spreadsheet or database, along with
          information such as the nature of the IP, owner of the IP, important
          dates such as priority and renewal dates, and value of the IP, among
          other data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Analyse the portfolio and identify how to maximise the commercial
          value of each item (which IP to maintain, which should be registered
          for protection, which can be allowed to lapse or considered
          insignificant, which IP should be expanded, which can provide added
          revenue through license royalties, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Conduct searches to identify possible infringing acts done by the
          company or against the company&apos;s IP.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Baxter IP is able to conduct a full-scope IP audit including a complete
        assessment of all relevant IP and IP related materials, or
        alternatively, narrow the scope to particular types of IP or materials,
        depending on your company&apos;s focus.
      </p>

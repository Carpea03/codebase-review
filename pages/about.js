      <h3>Most awarded mid-sized patent &amp; trade mark firm in Australia</h3>
      <p>
        We are one of the most awarded mid-sized firms in Australia,
        particularly for our expertise in software patenting. In addition, many
        of our attorneys have individually received awards too.
      </p>
      <h3>Outstanding and proven client service track record</h3>
      <p>
        Whilst we are appreciative of the awards we have received, what is much
        more important to us is the experience clients have in working with us.
        We survey our clients every six months and our latest Net Promoter Score
        was an outstanding 77 in 2021. Net Promoter score is the normative
        scoring method for client happiness used by large corporations and
        scores range from -100 to +100.

        From in-house experience managing hundreds of trade marks for large
        international brands to addressing cease and desist letters from
        international corporations, our trade mark attorneys can strengthen and
        defend your brand. Our trade mark team is always discussing latest case
        outcomes and developments in case law and practice on our internal
        professional development platform, so we are poised to give your
        valuable trade mark the best opportunity for success.

      <h3>Advice reinforced by IP enforcement and litigation experience</h3>
      <p>
        We work closely with lawyers and barristers to defend and enforce client
        IP rights, effectively providing end-to-end service for contentious
        matters. We filter the learnings and knowledge from contentious cases
        and patent litigation back up to our patent and trade mark attorneys, so
        we can draft stronger, more defensible patent and trade mark
        applications. If the ability to enforce your intellectual property is
        part of your commercial risk mitigation strategy, you are in no better
        hands than Baxter IP.

      <h1>How to become a patent attorney</h1>
      <p>
        A patent is a government granted monopoly that provides a patent owner
        the exclusive right to prevent others from making, using or selling an
        invention that is the subject of the patent in any country in which the
        patent has been granted. The typical term for the monopoly granted by a
        patent is 20 years from the original filing date of a patent
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        <Link href="/patent-attorney">Patent attorneys</Link> are intellectual
        property attorneys who are responsible for writing and filing patent
        applications. It is also their duty to protect the rights of their
        clients, the inventors and their patents, before organisations such as
        Patent and Trademark Offices (PTO). The work of these{' '}
        <Link href="/ip-attorney">intellectual property attorneys</Link> is
        meticulous in nature and involves preparing and then arguing the
        validity of patent documents, where the meaning of each word can count
        towards determining individualised monopolies of protection.
      </p>
      <h2>Requirements for becoming a patent attorney</h2>
      <p>
        To become a patent attorney in most countries, including Australia, you
        must first obtain a technical undergraduate degree in a field of
        engineering or science. Then, you need to obtain relevant qualifications
        and experience in intellectual property law.
      </p>
      <h3>Can you become a patent attorney solely with a law degree?</h3>
      <p>
        No, a law degree alone will not qualify you for this IP career. Patent
        attorneys require in-depth technical understanding of a{' '}
        <Link href="/specialisations">patentable field</Link> as well as
        specific training and experience in intellectual property law.
      </p>
      <h3>How to become a patent attorney without a legal degree</h3>
      <p>
        In some countries, including Australia, Canada and the United States,
        you can work as a patent agent without ever being required to become an
        attorney-at-law. In Australia, a &quot;patent agent&quot; is also known
        as a &quot;patent attorney&quot;, hence the confusion in comparing job
        titles across jurisdictions. Nonetheless, a patent agent still needs to
        have an engineering or scientific bachelor qualification and have
        studied the relevant intellectual property law course required in their
        jurisdiction. Depending on jurisdiction, some practical experience
        working under a registered patent attorney may also be required. In
        Australia, you will require two years of practical experience working
        under the supervision of a qualified Australian patent attorney with at
        least 5 years post qualification experience.
      </p>
      <h3>How to become a patent attorney</h3>
      <p>
        The best way to become a patent attorney is to complete an undergraduate
        degree in a hard science or engineering subject, followed by a
        postgraduate qualification in law (or specifically intellectual property
        law). In addition to having an interest in the technical fields you
        studied in, you should also have a passion for legal argument, be
        persuasive, and possess an eye for detail. As a patent attorney, you
        should also have strong commercial awareness so that you can understand
        and support the business objectives of your clients.
      </p>
      <h2>Why you should become a patent attorney</h2>
      <p>
        As a patent attorney, you can ensure that inventors receive fair
        compensation for their efforts by helping them to secure and protect
        exclusive rights to profit from their invention for a period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patent attorneys are tasked with assessing whether inventions are
        innovative and new, as well as determining which inventions are eligible
        for patenting. Patent attorneys are specially trained to draft patent
        applications and have to be equipped with knowledge of intellectual
        property law so that they can lead companies and inventors through the
        required process of obtaining their patents and commercialising their
        inventions. They also act to protect inventors when their rights are
        infringed.
      </p>
      <h3>Responsibilities of a patent attorney</h3>
      <p>The responsibilities of a patent attorney are to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Write detailed technical / engineering / scientific descriptions of
          inventions using very exact language in the proper formats.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write patent claims to define the legal scope and variations of the
          monopoly conferred by the patent when it is granted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that the filing, examination and renewal related deadlines of
          IP rights are met.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stay up to date with legal developments in the intellectual property
          field in your jurisdiction and other major jurisdictions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Discuss a client&apos;s inventions and the patent processes with
          inventors and licensees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enforce and defend patents. In some countries, including Australia,
          this is done by working closely with barristers and solicitors.
        </li>
        <li>Mentor and tutor trainee patent attorneys.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The day-to-day working life of a patent attorney</h3>
      <p>
        It is advisable for a patent attorney to be part of a team with whom
        they can share views and perspectives and from who they can learn. The
        work can involve a lot of pressure at times, as a result either of
        working on many different patent applications within a short space of
        time or of needing to meet inflexible deadlines that arise during the
        patent process. Despite having a traditionally quite narrow scope of
        work, being a patent attorney has excellent career prospects.
      </p>
      <p>
        As in every profession, it is always challenging for a new trainee to
        gain a foothold in the profession. In some parts of the world, such as
        the UK, US and France, competition is fierce, and new trainees are
        encouraged to apply for regional positions. The majority of a patent
        attorney&apos;s work is office-based, but it is not uncommon for them to
        travel to meet with clients, particularly if they are sole
        practitioners.
      </p>
      <h3>Skills needed to become a patent attorney</h3>
      <p>Patent attorneys need to have the following skill sets:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A high level of diligence and attention to detail, as accurate
          monitoring of legal deadlines is crucial.
        </li>
        <li>
          Excellent written and communication skills with both team members and
          external parties such as patent offices, as the communication of
          complex concepts is often required.
        </li>
        <li>
          An understanding of technological and scientific principles in the
          relevant fields of technology you are practising in.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability to express technical ideas that are complex in a concise
          and exact manner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Workload management skills, as patent attorneys are normally managing
          a portfolio of several hundred cases at any given point in time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Employers of patent attorneys</h2>
      <p>
        The main types of employers for patent attorneys are large industrial
        companies and private practice firms. Industrial companies that employ
        patent attorneys vary across a wide range of innovative fields,
        including software and fintech, industrial processing equipment, food,
        medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Private practice
        firms often have <Link href="/ip-careers">IP career pages</Link> on
        their websites that patent attorneys seeking employment can view to find
        out about positions being advertised, or about the size of the firm and
        the technology areas they cover. If you are a trainee patent attorney,
        you would generally do best to apply to patent attorney firms that
        practice in the technology area you are trained in, as they are more
        likely to be interested in you.
      </p>
      <h3>Remuneration for a patent attorney</h3>
      <p>
        Just like in any IP career, the salaries and benefits of being a patent
        attorney vary with the position you hold, your experience level and your
        location. According to the 2016 annual survey by IP recruitment firm the
        Patent Attorney Job Board, salaries for trainee patent attorneys range
        from AUD 50,500 &ndash; AUD 80,000 p.a., with remuneration increasing as
        experience grows, as shown below. Salaried partners in patent attorney
        firms can earn as much as AUD 200,000, with equity partners achieving up
        to AUD 300,000 or higher. The higher salary ranges are typically seen in
        NSW and Victoria, while patent attorneys in SA and WA tend to receive
        lower levels of remuneration.

      <h3>Professional development for a patent attorney</h3>
      <p>
        To maintain registration as a qualified patent attorney, attorneys must,
        in most countries, undertake continuing professional development each
        year. To do this, you can attend webinars and seminars on intellectual
        property law or on patent work. Such seminars may be organised by either
        a national Institute of Patent Attorneys or other relevant
        organisations.
      </p>
      <h2>Working abroad as a patent attorney</h2>
      <p>
        In countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK, there
        has been an increase in the number of candidates that are passing the
        European Qualifying Examination (EQEs) in order for them to become
        European patent attorneys. Private and public patent law firms are
        accepting and employing patent attorneys from different jurisdictions,
        such as the Commonwealth and Europe, in order to keep up with the demand
        for their services.
      </p>
      <h3>How to become a patent attorney in Australia and New Zealand</h3>

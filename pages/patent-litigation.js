      <h1>Patent litigation</h1>
      <h2>An overview of patent litigation</h2>

      <p>
        Once granted, a patent gives its owner the right to commence patent
        litigation and to seek an injunction and compensation for an
        infringement case. There are however many approaches to intellectual
        property enforcement that do not involve patent litigation and in any
        case should be considered first.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Before considering patent litigation &ndash; what to do if you think
        someone is infringing your patent?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Where it is believed that a patent is being infringed, making some
        attempt to resolve the dispute without going to court is usually a
        sensible idea. In fact, dispute resolution is a pre-condition to
        commencing IP litigation in the Federal Court (see the section on
        &ldquo;genuine steps&rdquo; below).
      </p>

      <p>
        Simply threatening others with a lawsuit for patent infringement can get
        you into trouble. Care needs to be taken in communications with an
        alleged infringer. This is because of{' '}
        <em>Section 128 of Patents Act 1990 (Cth)</em> (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;),
        which enables a party threatened with infringement proceedings to bring
        an action for damages and an injunction against the person making the
        threats.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even general threats not directed at a particular party can be
        sufficient to ground such a claim<sup>1.</sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, allegations of patent infringement will not be
        &ldquo;unjustifiable&rdquo; if infringement is proven in subsequent
        court proceedings. Where a claim under s128 is brought, the patent
        holder can bring a counter-claim for patent infringement pursuant to
        s130 of the Act.
      </p>

      <h2>Commencement of patent litigation</h2>

      <h3>Jurisdiction of patent litigation</h3>

      <p>
        Most, if not all, patent litigation is commenced in the Federal Court,
        although the Supreme Courts of each State have the jurisdiction to hear
        such claims. The primary reason for this is that the Federal Court has a
        specialist panel of patent judges with specialist experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Infringement claims can be brought either by the patent owner or an
        exclusive licensee. Where an exclusive licensee brings an action for
        intellectual property enforcement, the owner must be joined either as a
        co-applicant or a respondent.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Originating process &amp; Statement of claim &ndash; what are they?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Patent litigation proceedings in the Federal Court are commenced by the
        filing of two documents: an originating application; and a statement of
        claim.
      </p>

      <p>
        Put simply, an originating application sets out the orders (or
        &ldquo;relief&rdquo;) you want the court to make if you are successful.
        You may also seek interim or interlocutory relief to protect you in the
        period leading up to the final hearing. An interim injunction to prevent
        infringement until the matter is determined at trial is a good example.
      </p>

      <p>
        A statement of claim sets out, in summary form, the nature of your claim
        and the material facts on which it is based.
      </p>

      <p>
        One further document is usually required to be filed in patent
        infringement proceedings: a &ldquo;genuine steps statement&rdquo;. This
        statement sets out the &ldquo;sincere and genuine&rdquo; attempts taken
        to resolve the dispute with the opposing party or an explanation of why
        no such steps were taken.
      </p>

      <h2>What happens after filing the Originating Application?</h2>

      <p>
        Once the originating application and statement of claim have been filed,
        they need to be served on the other party. The first court date will be
        set down around 5 weeks from the date of filing. At the time of filing,
        the matter will be allocated at random to a single judge. That judge
        will remain in the matter until trial.
      </p>

      <p>
        This first court date (&ldquo;directions hearing&rdquo;) marks the
        court&apos;s supervision of preparing the matter ready for trial. These
        steps include the following: setting timetables for the exchange of
        documents; hearing applications for interim orders; referrals to
        mediation; directions as to the preparation of expert evidence and the
        method by which such expert evidence will be received.
      </p>

      <p>
        More details about the steps between filing and trial are set out in the
        Federal Court&apos;s{' '}

        </Link>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        By way of overview, the typical steps between filing and trial are as
        follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Pleadings:</strong> a respondent has 28 days to file a
          defence, which responds to the allegations in the statement of claim.
          An applicant then has an opportunity to reply to the defence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Discovery:</strong> this is the process whereby parties
          exchange the documents in their possession that are relevant to the
          case.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evidence:</strong> the exchange of witness statements setting
          out the evidence each witness which the parties intend to rely on at
          the trial. This includes any expert evidence.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        It is not possible to be specific about how long the court process takes
        from filing to trial, as it depends on the workload of the court and the
        complexity of the issues in a particular case. However, as a rough
        guide, it might be assumed that the process takes around 12 months.
      </p>

      <p>
        One the trial is held, it is also common for the judge to reserve their
        decision regarding the patent litigation proceedings. Depending on the
        workload of the judge and the complexity of the issues, it may take from
        weeks to months for the decision of the judge to be delivered.
      </p>

      <h3>Separate patent enforcement issues?</h3>

      <p>
        It is normal for patent litigation to be split into separate issues of
        liability and damages (or quantum), with a trial limited to the question
        of liability to be decided first. This means that whether a patent is
        infringed is determined separately from how much the claim is worth.
        Often, once liability is proved, the infringer will be willing to
        negotiate an amount of compensation without the need for a further trial
        on that issue. In that way, the costs of the legal proceedings can be
        kept to a minimum.
      </p>

      <h3>What if the matter is urgent?</h3>

      <p>
        At any time, even prior to commencing IP litigation proceedings, an
        urgent application can be made to the duty judge of the Federal Court at
        short notice (and even, in the appropriate case, out of hours, and/or
        without notice to the alleged infringer).
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, it might be necessary to obtain an urgent injunction to
        restrain an impending infringement that might materially affect the
        patent holder&apos;s market position. Alternatively, there might be some
        concern that the alleged infringer will remove assets outside the
        jurisdiction before the court proceedings can be determined.
      </p>

      <h2>Costs</h2>

      <p>
        The usual rule in intellectual property enforcement court proceedings is
        that the unsuccessful party is usually required to pay a proportion of
        the legal costs of the successful party. Typically this will be between
        60% to 70% of the costs of the successful party. In some limited
        circumstances, such as where an offer to settle has been rejected, a
        party can be required to pay the other party&apos;s costs on an
        &ldquo;indemnity&rdquo;, which covers almost all the costs of that
        party.

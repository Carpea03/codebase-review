      <h1>Special types of trade marks</h1>
      <h2 id="collective">Collective trade marks</h2>
      <p>
        Collective trade marks are used by members of a certain organisation.
        They function similarly to certification trade marks but, unlike
        standard trade marks, collective trade marks cannot be sold, assigned or
        leased to another party. Collective trade marks are similar to
        certification trade marks in that the party registering the trade mark
        is not necessarily the party who will be using the mark.
      </p>
      <h3>Functions of a collective trade mark</h3>
      <p>
        Collective trade marks are trade marks used by members of an association
        to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Differentiate the association&apos;s goods or services from the{' '}
          <Link href="/classes-of-goods-and-services">goods or services</Link>{' '}
          outside the association; or
        </li>
        <li>To identify membership within the organization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this way, the collective trade mark is used both for commerce and
        identification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applying for a collective trade mark follows the same process as{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-registration-process">
          applying for a regular trade mark
        </Link>
        . Similarly to a regular trade mark, the registered collective trade
        mark remains protected as long as all{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-renewal">renewal fees</Link> are paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        One important difference between collective trade marks and regular
        trade marks is that collective trade marks cannot be sold or assigned to
        another owner.
      </p>
      <h3>Who can apply for a collective trade mark?</h3>
      <p>
        The application for a collective trade mark must be filed by an
        organisation or association. This means that an individual may not
        solely file for an application.
      </p>
      <p>
        An association may be incorporated, such as FTD Inc. or unincorporated,
        such as the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW).

                The International Alliance of Research Universities, or IARU, is
                a group of universities that work together to research and
                correct major issues in the world and provide students and
                faculty with opportunities they would not otherwise have. The
                group has a collective trade mark registered under trade mark
                number 1124464. The IARU provides students with internships,
                research opportunities, and discussions on public issues. In
                order to be eligible for these opportunities, a student must be
                enrolled in one of the IARU universities.

      <h2 id="certification">Certification trade marks</h2>
      <p>
        Certification trade marks are applied for{' '}
        <Link href="/classes-of-goods-and-services">goods and services</Link>{' '}
        that meet a certain standard. Examples of such standards or
        characteristic include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A specific standard of quality to which the goods or services are
          adhering to;
        </li>
        <li>A specific composition that the goods possess;</li>
        <li>A manufacturing method that the goods underwent; or</li>
        <li>A geographical origin from which the goods come from.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Notably, a certification trade mark is ideal for protecting geographical
        indications. One such example is Scotch Whiskey.
      </p>
      <h3>Who can use a certification trade mark?</h3>
      <p>
        A certification trade mark can be used by different traders on their
        goods and services.
      </p>
      <h3>How do you apply for a certification trade mark?</h3>
      <p>
        Applying for a certification trade mark follows the same process as{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-registration-process">
          applying for a regular trade mark
        </Link>
        . The only difference is that a copy of the certification trade
        mark&apos;s set of rules is provided by the applicant within the
        application process. The set of rules ensures that the standard or
        characteristic is always satisfied by the product or service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The applicant of the certification trade mark is responsible for
        ensuring that the goods or services adhere to the set of rules provided
        by the applicant. The application and the rules will be approved by the
        Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
      </p>
      <h3>What are certification rules?</h3>
      <p>
        At a minimum, the certification rules that the applicant needs to submit
        must:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Define the standard or characteristic that the goods or services
          adheres to;
        </li>
        <li>
          Define a way for the applicant to know when the goods or services are
          not adhering to the specified standard or characteristic;
        </li>
        <li>
          Define the qualifications of the person certifying the compliance of
          the goods and services to the standard or characteristic;
        </li>
        <li>
          Define the conditions that the owner or qualified user of the trade
          mark must comply with before using the trade mark; or
        </li>
        <li>
          Define the steps taken for resolving conflicts regarding compliance or
          non-compliance with the standard or characteristic.

      <h3 id="geographical-indication">Geographical indication trade marks</h3>
      <p>
        A geographical indication (GI) refers to a name or sign that links a
        product back to a specific origin and attributes to the product certain
        qualities or characteristics that are specific only to that geographical
        area.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Australia, GIs are protected by certification trade marks as well as
        special legislation for foreign and Australian geographical indications
        and the Australian consumer law. Special legislations state that falsely
        claiming a graphical indication is a criminal offense, whereas the
        Australian Consumer Law sanctions parties who deliberately seek to
        mislead or deceive consumers, in this case, by falsely stating the
        geographical origin or geographical indication of a product.
      </p>
      <h4>How to register a geographical indication in Australia</h4>
      <p>
        Two systems are in place to register a GI in the country. First mode of
        protection for geographical indicators in Australia is through applying
        for a certification trade mark (in relation to all goods).
      </p>
      <p>
        The second route for protecting GI is through a sui generis system that
        applies to wine and grape products and is administered by the Australian
        Grape and Wine Authority. To date, more than 100 Australian and 2000
        European wine geographical indications have been recorded in the
        registry.

      <h2 id="defensive">Defensive trade marks</h2>
      <p>
        Defensive trade mark applications are generally filed by owners of
        well-known marks in respect of{' '}
        <Link href="/classes-of-goods-and-services">goods/services</Link> they
        have no intention of using, but for which they wish to proactively
        prevent another party from using or applying for a similar trade mark
        that would imply a connection to their brand under different goods and
        services. Defensive trade mark registration provides protection for
        extensively used trade marks against the misuse of their trade mark in a
        way that would harm the value or reputation of the trade mark. It also
        protects consumers from confusion that comes from a third party using a
        trade mark that is well-known.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the <em>Trade Marks Act 1995</em>, the owner of a defensive
        trade mark registration can obtain relief if their trade mark has been
        infringed. A defensive trade mark registration provides the most
        convenient access to relief from misuse of a trade mark. For a defensive
        trade mark, there is no requirement to use the trade mark covered by the
        registration. For this reason, a defensive trade mark cannot be removed
        from the register because of non-use.
      </p>
      <p>
        One requirement for filing a defensive trade marks is that the trade
        mark should be already registered under its corresponding classes of
        goods and services during the time of application of the defensive trade
        mark.

                The trade mark owner of VOGUE registered defensive trade marks
                under Class 42 in relation to retail and wholesale services in
                respect of perfume, essential oils, cosmetics, hair lotions,
                shampoos, hair conditioners, toilet soaps, printed matter,

                other classes covering goods like rugs and mats and real estate
                services). VOGUE may have no interest in using the goods under
                the aforementioned classes; however, as a well-known brand, they
                wish to prevent any other trader from improperly using the mark
                for different goods.
                <p>
                  In addition, defensive marks are not subject to non-use
                  disputes, so a salon owner who wants to use the word
                  &ldquo;Vogue&rdquo; cannot file a request for removal due to
                  non-use against the owner of the VOGUE trade mark.

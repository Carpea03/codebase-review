      <h1>Opposing a Patent Application</h1>

      <p>
        A patent opposition is an adversarial mechanism provided in the{' '}
        <em>Patents Act</em> for a third party to oppose the grant of a standard
        patent or the certification of an innovation patent. Any person
        (opponent), such as a competitor, supplier or customer, can lodge and
        progress an opposition to a Hearing at{' '}

        (rather than the Courts) to prevent invalid intellectual property rights
        from being awarded to the patentee (applicant).
      </p>
      <p>
        The examination of patents is a broad sieve to eliminate invalid patents
        being granted but cannot work perfectly regardless of how thorough a
        search is conducted, as not all prior art is readily available to the
        Examiner. Through the patent opposition system, a finer review is
        possible as the opposition Hearing Officer can be made aware of
        information that may not have been readily available to the Examiner or
        can be directed to other prior art information from around the world
        that was not found during the examination process.
      </p>

      <p>
        The legislator recognises two basic functions of the patent opposition
        system:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          to improve the likelihood that only valid patents are granted or
          certified; and
        </li>
        <li>
          to provide a simpler, more efficient, and less costly alternative to
          Courts to settle determination of scope of valid IP rights for granted
          patents.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In this manner, any expenditure on post-grant enforcement of those IP
        rights, including against an infringer of the intellectual property is
        less financially risky.
      </p>

      <h2>Strategy prior to patent opposition</h2>

      <p>
        It is important before launching into a patent opposition system to
        review the case carefully to ensure this is the best approach. Those
        review steps include determining:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>What is the commercial result being sought?</li>
        <li>
          What are the technical arguments on patentability to be used in the
          patent opposition?
        </li>
        <li>
          What needs to be done to present an opposition thoroughly?
          <ul>
            <li>Is a detailed search required?</li>
            <li>Is a detailed validity opinion required?</li>
            <li>Is Barrister representation valuable?</li>
            <li>Is independent expert evidence required?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Is success likely and what are the costs?</li>
        <li>
          Is there a better patent approach or more effective procedural
          mechanism?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Commercial strategy alongside or instead of patent opposition</h2>

      <p>
        It is easy to blindly proceed along a legal path not carefully aligned
        with commercial objectives. However, the project or business objectives
        are always the primary concern.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Baxter IP, we start contentious matters by setting our legal
        knowledge, skill and experience to one side and instead probe to gain a
        deep understanding of the business, the other side, any competing
        products, the market and the actual commercial case for the opposition.
      </p>

      <p>
        The commercial result required drives our approach to the patent
        opposition. However, it is important to determine how else that
        commercial outcome might be achieved. Some commercial matters to be
        considered are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Is the commercial aim to stop others using the invention in the
          relevant industry or to allow you to operate using the invention in
          the industry or in a similar industry?
        </li>
        <li>
          Are you trying to coexist with the commercial opponent or obtain a
          commercial advantage over the opponent?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is negotiation with an indication of strength of position supported by
          the ability to lodge patent opposition (but without actually lodging
          the opposition) a viable commercial approach?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is there a commercial effect on your business, including your wider
          business community such as distributors, that is affected by this
          legal matter?
        </li>
        <li>
          Has the balance of commercial cost effectiveness of lodging an
          opposition been assessed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Overview of patent opposition</h2>

      <p>In general, the objectives of patent opposition are:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>To reduce the probability of an invalid patent being granted;</li>
        <li>
          To give the examiner the opportunity to scrutinise evidence or
          documents that would not have otherwise been available (or readily
          available) without the opposition proceedings;
        </li>
        <li>To avoid costly patent litigation post patent grant; and/or</li>
        <li>
          To enable possible clarity to commercial parties as to the valid scope
          of claims when a patent becomes enforceable.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Grounds for patent opposition</h2>

      <p>Possible grounds for patent opposition include:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          If the nominated person
          <ul>
            <li>is not entitled for patent grant according to section 33(1)</li>
            <li>is entitled for grant only with another person</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If the invention itself is not patentable, such as
          <ol type="a">
            <li>The invention is not a manner of manufacture</li>
            <li>
              Compared to prior art,
              <ul>
                <li>the invention is not novel; or</li>
                <li>the invention does not involve an inventive step</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The invention was secretly used before the priority date of the
              patent claim by, on behalf of or as authorised by the patentee, a
              nominated person, or any of their predecessors.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>When is a patent opposition lodged?</h2>

      <p>
        For an Australian standard patent, patent opposition can be filed at any
        time from publication of acceptance of the patent application to three
        months from that date. An opposition to an Australian Innovation Patent
        can be filed at any time after it has been certified.

      </figure>

      <h2>Documents and evidence provided in patent applications</h2>

      <p>
        In the Statement of Grounds and Particulars, the opponent must keep in
        mind and be as comprehensive as possible when filing the document
        because amendment can only be requested to address clerical errors. In
        addition, the type of evidence provided in the second stage of patent
        opposition should depend on the ultimate goal of the opposition, and the
        submissions must be detailed and comprehensive enough to aid the Patent
        Office in assessing the matter. Thus, the aid of a patent attorney who
        is well-versed in patent oppositions is crucial in preparing the
        documents and evidence to be filed in order for your patent opposition
        goals to be met.
      </p>

      <h2>Hearing of Opposition</h2>

      <p>
        It should be remembered that the case is NOT argued in the evidence. The
        evidence is the factual matters that support your legal arguments. The
        legal case is presented at the Hearing and the various parts of the
        evidence are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Evidence in support of the opposition, which is provided by the
          opponent;
        </li>
        <li>Evidence in answer, which is provided by the applicant; and</li>
        <li>Evidence in reply, which is provided by the opponent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Evidence presented in these sections serve highly specific functions.
        Evidence in support should be in the confines of and reinforce the case
        as stated in the statement of grounds in particulars. Evidence in answer
        is the main time for the applicant to provide their evidence in response
        to the opposition grounds, particulars and evidence in support. Evidence
        in reply, which is supplied by the opponent, should only serve to rebut
        the evidence in answer submitted by the applicant in response to the
        evidence in support of the opposition; it should not raise a new
        argument that should have been presented in the evidence in support and
        should not contain merely confirmatory statements supporting the
        existing evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        It can therefore be seen that the whole process of the Opposition must
        be considered and planned at the start and reviewed throughout the
        process. Knowledge experience and forward planning skills are required
        and provided well by the expert Opposition teams at Baxter IP.
      </p>

      <h2>Appeal</h2>

      <p>
        The Opposition process is a process out of the Courts in an
        Administrative law setting of IP Australia. However there are possible
        appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) or the Federal
        Court within a very restricted appeal timeline (usually 21 &ndash; 28
        days).

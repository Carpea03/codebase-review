        <h1>Australian Patent Search</h1>
        <p>
          Compared with many other countries, a patent search in Australia is
          relatively straightforward because IP Australia offers a sophisticated
          patent database and patent search system to the general public â€“
          called AusPat. AusPat covers Australian patent records right back to
          1904.
        </p>
        <p>
          Australian patent searches can be carried out by patent number,
          applicant name, inventor name and many other more sophisticated

          carry out your Australian patent search because a few strategies need
          to be applied to identify the right entity and not miss relevant
          search results.

          If you are trying to determine whether your new idea is patentable in
          Australia, ironically, an Australian patent search is probably not
          going to give you the correct answer. The reason for this is that for
          a new idea to be patentable, it must be novel in light of all
          published documents worldwide, and not just in Australia.{' '}

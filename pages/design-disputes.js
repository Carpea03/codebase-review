      <h1>Design disputes</h1>
      <p>
        The two- or three-dimensional appearance of an article can be protected
        through <Link href="/registered-designs">design registration</Link>.
        Design registration grants the owner a 10 year monopoly on the visual
        appearance of a product, with the registration being renewed five years
        into the lifetime of the registered design. Failure to renew
        registration after five years will cause the registration to lapse,
        meaning that the design will be entered into the public domain and can
        be used by anyone.
      </p>
      <p>In general, to be registered, a design should be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          new, meaning it has not been previously used in Australia, published
          in any document anywhere else in the world, nor submitted for
          application with an earlier priority date; and
        </li>
        <li>
          distinctive, meaning that it should not look substantially similar in
          appearance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Unlike in other jurisdictions, registered designs in Australia are
        enforceable only after being certified. Unregistered designs are only
        eligible for seeking relief through the common law tort of passing off
        and Australian Consumer Law on the basis of the good will established by
        the reputable use of the registered design.
      </p>
      <h2>Registration vs Certification</h2>
      <p>
        To register a design,{' '}
        <Link

          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">
          IP Australia
        </Link>{' '}
        conducts a formalities examination, after which the design is
        registered. On the other hand, certification of examination is usually
        sought in order to enforce the registered design right against an
        infringement and entails a more thorough examination of the prior art.
      </p>
      <h2>What is a design dispute?</h2>
      <p>
        A design dispute is an avenue provided by the <em>Designs Act 2003</em>{' '}
        to enforce one&apos;s right as the owner of a registered design against
        an infringing party. Design infringement may occur even without
        knowledge of &ldquo;prior art&rdquo; on the part of the infringing
        party.
      </p>
      <h2>Who can own a registered design?</h2>
      <p>
        In cases of design disputes, design registration can be disputed if an
        ineligible party is deemed the owner of the design. In Australia, the
        following parties are eligible to own registered designs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The actual author of the design</li>
        <li>The employer of the designer</li>
        <li>The party who commissioned to have the design made</li>
        <li>A person to whom the designer assigned the design in writing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In cases of two or more parties having interest in the design, the
        application must be made jointly and under all the names of the parties
        involved.
      </p>
      <h2>Steps in addressing design disputes</h2>
      <h3>Certification</h3>
      <p>
        For the owner of the registered design, the first step is to have the
        registered design certified, because only certified registered designs
        can be enforced in Australia. Certification entails a substantive
        examination in contrast to the formalities examination for registration.
        To be certified, the Designs Office will check if the design is new and
        not offensive (containing graphic words or images). The design should
        also be free of any protected emblems (such as flags and signets).
      </p>
      <h3>Scenario 1. Addressing an infringing party</h3>
      <p>
        To address an infringing party, the design must be in force.
        Certification is required for a registered design to be enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
        After registration and certification, a cease and desist letter to the
        infringing party is typically sufficient to stop the infringing
        behavior; otherwise, alternative dispute resolution and sometimes
        litigation ensues. Note that the cease and desist letter should be
        written with utmost care, because if the claims in the letter are proven
        groundless, the accused may be awarded costs. Conversely, if
        infringement is proven, the infringing party may be liable to pay for
        damages or an account of profits.
      </p>
      <h3>Scenario 2. Addressing a cease and desist letter</h3>
      <p>
        Upon receiving a cease and desist letter, one may be involved in dispute
        settlement through alternative dispute resolution routes, such as
        negotiation, mediation or arbitration. An application may be sought to
        have the existing registered design revoked by proving that the design
        being infringed should not have been registered in the first place. Any
        party can request IP Australia re-examine a registered design provided
        that they have information on relevant designs used prior to the filing
        date of the contested registered design.
      </p>
      <h3>The role of an IP attorney in design disputes</h3>
      <p>
        The services of an experienced{' '}
        <Link href="/ip-attorney">IP attorney</Link> is invaluable in design
        disputes. Your IP attorney can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>File your design and seek to have it certified.</li>
        <li>Draft a cease and desist letter with careful consideration.</li>
        <li>
          Represent the client in cases of alternative dispute resolution or
          advise the client in conjunction with legal advice if the matter
          escalates to design litigation in court.

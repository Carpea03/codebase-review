      <h1>Opposing a patent application</h1>
      <h2>Acceptance of a patent application</h2>

      <p>
        A patent application goes through an{' '}
        <Link href="/patent-examination">examination process</Link> prior to
        grant. The Examiner may raise a number of objections. If no objections
        are raised, or once the objections have been successfully addressed by
        the applicant, a patent application will be accepted. If no opposition
        proceedings are started within three months of the patent being
        advertised as accepted, the patent will be granted upon payment of the
        required fees. A patent will generally last for 20 years (up to 25 years
        for some{' '}
        <Link href="/specialisations/pharmaceutical-patents">
          pharmaceutical patents
        </Link>
        ) provided the annual renewal fees are paid.
      </p>

      <h2>Opposition to grant of a standard patent</h2>

      <p>
        After a{' '}
        <Link href="/patent-application">standard patent application</Link> is
        advertised as being accepted in the{' '}
        <em>Australian Official Journal of Patents</em>, there is a three-month
        period in which a notice of opposition to grant can be filed. Once a
        notice of opposition has been filed, the person lodging the notice has a
        further three months to lodge a statement of grounds and particulars.
        The statement of grounds and particulars sets out the basis for the
        opposition and needs to refer to documents that will be relied on to
        prove the grounds raised during the opposition and a copy of all the
        documents need to be submitted at the same time as the statement of
        grounds and particulars.
      </p>

      <h2>Grounds for opposition to grant</h2>

      <p>
        The grant of a patent may be opposed on a number of grounds. The grounds
        most often relied upon are that the invention is not novel and/or
        inventive or that the person listed as the owner of the patent is not
        entitled to the patent. It is important to note that ownership can be
        disputed at any time and is not limited to the same timing as filing an
        opposition notice. Further grounds for opposition are also mentioned
        below.
      </p>

      <h2>Stages in an opposition proceeding</h2>

      <p>
        Once the notice of opposition and statement of grounds and particulars
        has been filed, the following occurs:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The opponent has to file their evidence in support of the opposition
          within three months;
        </li>
        <li>The applicant has 3 months to file their evidence in answer;</li>
        <li>
          The opponent then has another 3 months to file evidence in reply.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Evidence is led through statutory declaration prepared by expert
        witnesses. Once all the evidence has been received, the Commissioner of
        Patents will review the evidence and decide whether to hold an oral
        hearing or a hearing by written submissions. Written submissions need to
        be prepared and submitted prior to the hearing. The deadline for written
        submissions to be submitted is ten days before the hearing for the
        opponent and five days for the applicant. If the hearing is solely by
        written submissions, the Commissioner will notify both parties of the
        relevant deadlines.
      </p>

      <h2>Decision</h2>

      <p>
        The Delegate shall notify both parties of the result of the opposition
        hearing within 3 months of the hearing. If the opposition is successful,
        the applicant is given an opportunity to amend the patent application to
        address the issues raised in the opposition. If the opposition is
        unsuccessful, the patent application will proceed to grant. Both parties
        may lodge an appeal with the Federal Court.
      </p>

      <h2>Costs</h2>

      <p>
        There are administrative costs associated with filing a notice of
        opposition. There may also be substantial legal costs and expert costs
        associated with the preparation and submission of evidence. An award of
        costs can be made in favour of the successful party but these are
        generally limited according to a schedule of charges set out in the
        patent regulations.
      </p>

      <h2>Other objections</h2>

      <p>
        A number of other objections can be raised at different stages of the
        application: These include an objection to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The ownership of the patent. A dispute in relation to ownership can be
          filed at any time before the grant of the patent.
        </li>
        <li>An applicant&apos;s request to amend the patent specification.</li>
        <li>The decision to grant an extension of time.</li>
        <li>An extension of the term of a pharmaceutical patent.</li>
        <li>
          The patent owner&apos;s decision to license the use of an invention.
        </li>
        <li>
          Process an applicant&apos;s request to amend their patent
          specification.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Alternatives to starting opposition proceedings</h2>

      <p>
        The costs of lodging and preparing expert evidence for opposition
        proceedings can be substantial. There are a number of other options
        which may prevent the grant of a patent without having to incur the
        costs of an opposition proceeding. These include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Lodging a notice under s27 of the <em>Patents Act</em>. This allows
          anyone to file submissions that may affect validity anytime from the
          time the patent specification is open to public inspection to three
          months after the publication of the acceptance of the patent
          specification. The notice allows any interested party to provide
          evidence that may challenge the requirements of novelty and/or
          inventive step of the patent application to be considered by the
          Examiner during examination or re-examination.
        </li>
        <li>
          Request for re-examination &ndash; any third party can request that a
          patent be re-examined. This is usually done on the grounds that the
          claims in the patent are for an invention that are not novel and/or
          inventive. However, a request for re-examination can be made on a
          number of other grounds such as that the claims are unclear. A request
          for re-examination can only be made after a patent has been granted.
          The party lodging the request can do so online and the request needs
          to include a description of the grounds as well as all supporting
          documentation.

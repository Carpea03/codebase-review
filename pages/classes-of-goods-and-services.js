        An application for trade mark registration contains a number of
        mandatory elements, including, the trade mark owner, the trade mark, and
        the goods and services. A trade mark can be categorised into 45
        international trade mark classes, known as the &quot;Nice
        Classification&quot;. Classes 1-34 cover goods, whilst Classes 35-45
        cover services.

      <h2>Broad vs specific trade mark classes</h2>
      <p>
        When selecting trade mark classes, all classes that are currently
        relevant to the business and also future interests should be considered.
        However, there are{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-pre-filing-considerations">considerations</Link>{' '}
        such as the cost, as fees for applications are dependent on the number
        of classes. Further, how broad the claim is will depend on the nature of
        the trade mark, the nature of the business and your plans and challenges
        for business expansion. This is something that needs to be considered on
        a case-by-case basis. Our experienced attorneys can guide you through
        this process.
      </p>
      <h2>Do it right the first time</h2>
      <p>
        The correct classes need to be identified when first lodging an
        application because the scope of the application cannot be broadened
        after filing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain misconceptions lead to the inclusion of incorrect or unnecessary
        classes in the trade mark application. For example, a trade mark does
        not need to incorporate all aspects of its internal business operations,
        such as advertising, accounting and web hosting. The classes in the
        trade mark application should be for goods and/or services that the
        business offers to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incorrect classes may result in delays and unnecessary fees. In the
        future, incorrect identification of goods/services may result in partial
        or total removal of the trade mark due to non-use. Worst case scenario,
        you will not have the scope of protection that your business needs. The
        advice of a <Link href="/trade-mark-attorney">trade mark attorney</Link>{' '}
        with extensive experience in identifying the appropriate classes and
        descriptions of goods/services is invaluable in this step in identifying
        and securing the correct scope of trade mark registration.

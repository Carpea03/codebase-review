      <h1>Patent costs in Australia</h1>
      <p>
        As <a href="/patent-attorney">patent attorneys</a>, we are continually
        surprised by the incorrect perceptions that exist around patent costs,
        including patent costs in Australia. Here we seek to address:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Patent costs vs. war stories</li>
        <li>How to choose your patent attorney</li>
        <li>How Baxter IP makes patent costs transparent</li>
        <li>Why the cost-conscious inventor should consider Baxter IP</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Patent costs vs. war stories</h2>

      <p>
        One of the best examples of a war story on patent costs that we&apos;ve
        heard was on Shark Tank 2015, during which an inventor claimed to have
        spent some $700,000 on IP costs prior to any sales of his device. This
        story goes to the crux of most war stories on patent cost in Australia
        and overseas, that is &ndash; don&apos;t spend money on patents if you
        are not creating a business (whether a manufacturing or R&amp;D and
        licensing business) or preparing to sell your patent in parallel to
        pursuing patent protection. If something significant is not happening on
        the commercial or capital front within 18 months of filing a provisional
        patent application this is normally an indicator that there is a
        misconception around patenting.
      </p>

      <p>
        The aim of intellectual property is to create far more value than its
        cost of acquisition, either directly via:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>patent sale; or</li>
        <li>patent licensing</li>
      </ol>

      <p>or indirectly by:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>protecting profit margins; or</li>
        <li>growing market share</li>
      </ol>

      <p>than the cost of obtaining that intellectual property.</p>

      <p>
        Where you are founding a startup or preparing to sell your patent, the
        patent system offers numerous opportunities to delay patent costs, for
        example:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          you can start the patent application process with an inexpensive{' '}
          <a href="/provisional-patents">provisional patent application</a> that
          will lay an international claim to your idea for the first 12 months
          without any further costs; and
        </li>
        <li>
          after the 12 month{' '}
          <a href="/provisional-patents">provisional patent application</a>{' '}
          period, you can then file a{' '}
          <a href="/pct-patent">PCT international patent application</a> to
          extend your international claim to your idea for another 18 months.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        All up, using the process we have outlined above and in relation to a
        simple{' '}
        <a href="/specialisations/consumer-product-patents">consumer product</a>{' '}
        invention, the total cost for maintaining your claim to the new idea for
        the first 2 Â½ years can be as low as $17k. Baxter IP employs numerous
        other strategies to maintain costs to a tight budget for our clients who
        are cost conscious.
      </p>

      <h2>Patent costs: how to choose your patent attorney?</h2>

      <h3>Based on the commercial outcomes you are seeking from your IP</h3>

      <p>
        You should patent for successful commercial outcomes, whether it is:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>A valid patent that you can enforce against an infringer;</li>
        <li>
          A valid patent that you can use to de-motivate or dissuade a
          competitor;
        </li>
        <li>
          A <a href="/provisional-patents">patent application</a> that enhances
          the value of your business during capital raising;
        </li>
        <li>A patent application that is purchased by a third party;</li>
        <li>A patent application that you license to third parties; or</li>
        <li>
          A valid patent that protects the profit margin of your products.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        So, how might your choice of patent attorney affect the potential for
        you to achieve a successful commercial outcome?
      </p>

      <p>
        In relation to 1 &amp; 2, to achieve a valid patent, your best chances
        are by working with an{' '}
        <a href="/patent-attorney">experienced patent attorney</a> who is a
        specialist in your technology area as they will understand the prior art
        more intimately and be able to get right to the heart of any objection
        an Examiner may raise. No patent attorney is an expert in all technology
        fields; thus, your best chances of finding a patent attorney with that
        specialist technical knowledge is within a medium sized patent attorney
        firm with multiple patent attorneys, rather than a one-person practice.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> There are numerous so-called &ldquo;patent
        attorney firms&rdquo; that are really just one-person- practices. How
        can you tell? Look at their staff page carefully; simply because they
        have multiple staff listed does not mean they have more than one patent
        attorney. Some staff may not be registered patent attorneys. It goes
        without saying, if the website does not list a registered Australian
        patent attorney by name &ndash; be very careful.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In relation to 3 to 5, it will be easier if you can work with a patent
        attorney who can add value by introducing you to commercial contacts who
        can assist you in capital raising / sale of IP and licensing. Further to
        this, investors and licensees will want to see a reputable patent
        attorney firm brand behind your intellectual property protection, and
        it&apos;s even better if they have had positive dealings with the firm
        previously.
      </p>

      <h3>To achieve the optimal balance between patent cost and risk</h3>

      <p>
        The patent application process is highly deadline oriented, and for some
        deadlines there are no extensions available &ndash; if they are missed,
        your <a href="/provisional-patents">patent application</a> will lapse.
        Therefore, the question that every inventor must ask is &ndash; what
        happens if my patent attorney is suddenly unable to look after my
        matter? For example, if they fall ill. This can be a real problem for a
        one-person practice, whereas the risk is mitigated by working with a
        firm with multiple patent attorneys.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, the quality of your patent work is of the utmost importance,
        and there can be a huge difference between a provisional patent
        application prepared by one firm and one prepared by another firm in
        terms of the final scope of legal protection achieved &ndash; we explain
        these differences and why they are important{' '}
        <a href="/provisional-patents">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>How does Baxter IP makes patent costs transparent?</h2>

      <p>
        Baxter IP was one of the first patent attorney firms in Australia to
        adopt a simple fixed-fee and capped-fee approach to carrying out
        intellectual property work for its clients. Here&apos;s how we make
        costs transparent:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          At the first meeting, we will give you a copy of our Patent
          Applicant&apos;s Guide which sets out for you our fixed costs and cost
          ranges for the entire patent process. This effectively allows you to
          create a patent budget for years into the future.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before conducting any action we will give you a fixed cost estimate
          for the action and will only commence work on the matter after there
          is agreement on price.

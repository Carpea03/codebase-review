      <h1>Freedom-to-operate patent search</h1>
      <h3>Why carry out a freedom-to-operate patent search</h3>

      <p>
        If you are looking to develop or release a new product, it is important
        to ascertain whether it would be open to a claim for infringement of
        intellectual property rights of a third party, for example, third-party
        patent rights. If the answer to this question is “no”, then you are said
        to have “freedom-to-operate”. A freedom-to-operate patent search is also
        known as a “patent clearance search” or a “patent infringement search”.
      </p>

      <p>
        A freedom-to-operate patent search addresses the risk associated with
        being blocked from market by a third party in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>development costs</li>
        <li>reputational damage</li>
        <li>withdrawal of products or services from the market</li>
        <li>legal costs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our clients who operate in crowded markets routinely have us carry out
        patent clearance searches. The first step in an Australian
        freedom-to-operate patent search is to identify granted Australian
        patents or patent applications (which would upon grant) that are live
        and that pose an infringement risk. Your product or proposed product is
        then analysed against the claims of the patents that have been
        identified by the patent clearance search.
      </p>

      <h2>How to achieve freedom-to-operate</h2>

      <p>
        When a third-party files a portfolio of patent applications, they
        generally will only file in a small selection of countries. For example,
        a patent applicant may only file a patent application in the United
        States and Europe &ndash; and not in Australia, in which case you can
        make and sell their patented invention in Australia and in every country
        other than the United States and Europe. The third-party patent
        application may have also been “knocked back” or limited during
        examination in some countries, and you may therefore still have
        freedom-to-operate in those countries.
      </p>

      <h2>What to do if you don&apos;t have freedom-to-operate</h2>

      <p>
        If you had a freedom-to-operate patent search carried out and discovered
        that you would infringe an existing patent if you were to proceed with
        your product, it&apos;s not the end of the road. There are at least 4
        paths you can go down:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          You can attempt to invalidate the patent by locating prior art.
          Sometimes, patent examiners miss important items of prior art that
          either alone, or in combination with other prior art documents, would
          invalidate or limit the claims of the granted patent. Furthermore,
          patent examiners will normally only look at patents and scientific
          publications and not more broadly at the prior art base, such as on
          commercial websites, forums or blogs. Patent examiners also easily
          miss prior art documents that are not in English &ndash; for example,
          those on the Russian Patent Office Database.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can attempt to obtain a license for the technology from the patent
          owner. You will most likely be successful in obtaining a license where
          the patent owners themselves have not commercialised a product in
          accordance with the patent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where you are the owner of a patent application that is of interest to
          the patent owner of the third-party patent, there is also the
          possibility of cross-licensing the two patent applications. This has
          become quite a popular solution employed by large companies to avoid
          patent litigation, but this approach is useful for all companies.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can attempt to design around the patent, that is, to ensure that
          your product design does not encompass all of the features of one of
          the claims of the third-party patent. Your patent attorney can help
          you with designing around an existing patent.

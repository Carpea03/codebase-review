      <h1>Australian Innovation Patents</h1>
      <p>
        Australian utility model patents are uniquely termed &ldquo;innovation
        patents&rdquo;. While an Australian innovation patent is considered a second
        tier Australian patent because of the lower threshold of patentability
        required for certification, it can be used as a powerful tool in patent
        litigation. The advantages and disadvantages of an innovation patent
        when compared with a standard patent are as follows.
      </p>

      <h2>Innovation Patent Filing Requirements</h2>

      <p>
        If an Australian innovation patent application is filed within 12 months
        of a foreign patent filing in a country that is a member of the Paris
        Convention, the patent can claim the filing date of the particular
        foreign patent.
      </p>

      <h3>Minimum innovation patent filing requirements:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A copy of the patent specification, claims, drawings (if applicable),
          abstract and title;
        </li>
        <li>
          If the patent specification is not in English, a verified English
          translation is required;
        </li>
        <li>Patent applicant&apos;s name and address;</li>
        <li>Inventor name; and</li>
        <li>
          The details of basic patent application (patent application number,
          country, patent filing date), if convention priority is to be claimed
          by the innovation patent application.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        IP Australia may also request for grant of an innovation patent in
        Australia:
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Before acceptance, a certified copy of the basic patent application
          must be filed
        </li>
        <li>
          If requested by IP Australia, a verified English translation of the
          basic patent application
        </li>
        <li>
          Notice of Entitlement which can be prepared and signed by an
          Australian Patent Attorney
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Not required for Australian innovation patents:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Power of Attorney</li>
        <li>Declarations signed by the inventor(s)</li>
        <li>
          Any other form that needs to be executed by the patent applicant or
          inventor
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Benefits of Australian innovation patents compared with standard
        Australian patents
      </h2>

      <p>
        Despite being a second tier patent, Australian innovation patents offer
        several advantages over standard patents. The benefits of an innovation
        patent include
      </p>

      <h3>Fast processing to patent grant</h3>

      <p>
        Grant of an Australian innovation patent is often achieved in less than
        8 weeks. This is because innovation patent applications are not subject
        to a pre-grant substantive patent examination (they are however
        subjected to a formalities examination).
      </p>

      <h3>Lower patentability requirements</h3>

      <p>
        The requirements for grant of an innovation patent filing to be granted
        are more easily met than for a standard patent. Specifically, the claims
        of innovation patents do not require an inventive step over the prior
        art. In place of this requirement is the requirement that innovation
        patent claims include an innovative step, although this requirement is
        readily met by the innovation in question making a substantial
        contribution to the working of the product or process. Since obviousness
        is not a legitimate argument for invalidity, innovation patents are
        difficult to invalidate.
      </p>

      <h3>Innovation patents as a patent litigation tool</h3>

      <p>
        Since innovation patents are relatively fast to obtain and difficult to
        invalidate, they are an ideal vehicle for Australia patent litigation.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Patent protection for incremental enhancements to products and processes
      </h3>

      <p>
        As innovation patents are subject to a lower threshold for
        patentability, they are particularly useful in protecting progressive
        enhancements to products and processes that may be obvious and therefore
        cannot be protected by a standard patent.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Disadvantages of Innovation patents compared to standard Australian
        patents
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Innovation patents have a patent term of only 8 years</li>
        <li>
          Innovation patents are limited to 5 patent claims (although all claims
          may be independent claims).

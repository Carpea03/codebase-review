      <h1>How to patent a new idea in Australia?</h1>
      <p>
        Patenting a new idea in Australia or internationally is a relatively
        straightforward process when working with an{' '}
        <Link
          title="Patent Attorneys Sydney &amp; Melbourne"
          href="/patent-attorney">
          Australian patent attorney
        </Link>
        . The patent process is not one to be embarked on without the advice of
        a patent attorney as your{' '}
        <Link
          title="File a Provisional Patent Application"
          href="/provisional-patents">
          patent application
        </Link>{' '}
        needs to establish a watertight foundation for the IP rights you are
        seeking.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>6 common questions prior to filing a patent application</h2>
      <h3>1. Do I need to file a patent application?</h3>
      <h4>A patent application allows you to license or sell your new idea</h4>
      <p>
        Without a patent application, you cannot (normally) sell or licence your
        new idea as there is no reason why a third party would not just copy it
        without paying you any fee.
      </p>
      <h4>
        A patent normally allows your business to operate at a higher profit
        margin
      </h4>
      <p>
        In most businesses, profits are very much tied to the margin created
        between the sale price of its products and the expenses associated with
        supplying them. A small difference in price point can lead to a large
        difference in profit margin. That is, if the cost to supply a product is
        $10 and it is sold for $11, there is a 10% profit margin, but if it were
        to be sold at $12, there is a 20% profit margin which equates to a 100%
        increase in profit.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a patent is granted on your new idea, you will be able to stop a
        third party copying it. Where you are able to stop a third party copying
        your new idea, you will have a monopoly over the sale of the new idea
        and can therefore dictate the sale price. This is why products that are
        patented generally sell at much higher profit margins than products that
        are not patented.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>2. How do I make money out of my patent application?</h3>
      <p>
        Filing a patent application does not automatically result in any income.
        Businesses create income. The question therefore becomes, how can your
        business take advantage of (i.e. commercialise) your patent application
        once filed?
      </p>
      <p>Patent applications are normally commercialised by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sale of the patent application and associated know-how to a company
          for a once-off payment
        </li>
        <li>
          Licensing the patent application for a defined royalty stream (e.g. a
          passive income stream as products are sold)
        </li>
        <li>A combination of the above</li>
        <li>Manufacturing and selling your new product</li>
        <li>
          Having someone else manufacture your new product and then start
          selling it?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3>3. Can my new idea be patented?</h3>
      <p>
        There are 3 basic tests a patent application needs to meet in order to
        be successfully granted:
      </p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>It must be new</li>
        <li>It must not be obvious; and</li>
        <li>It must be patentable subject matter</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To get an idea of the answer to A &amp; B, your patent attorney will
        normally request IP Australia to perform a patent search based on your
        provisional patent application. This patent search is called an{' '}
        <Link
          title="International-Type Patent Search"
          href="/international-type-search">
          International-Type Search
        </Link>{' '}
        and in our experience, is by far the best value-for-money patent search
        you can get done at an early stage in the patent process.
      </p>
      <p>
        To answer question C, in Australia, there is very little that is
        excluded so far as what can be patented. For example,{' '}
        <Link
          title="Software, Mobile &amp; Apps Patents"
          href="/specialisations/software-patents">
          software patents
        </Link>{' '}
        and{' '}
        <Link
          title="Medical Devices Patents"
          href="/specialisations/medical-patents">
          methods of medical treatment
        </Link>{' '}
        can generally be patented. All you need to do is provide your patent
        attorney with a clear and concise brief and they can advise you as to
        whether your idea is patentable subject matter in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be wondering, how you can trust your patent attorney with your
        idea?{' '}

        have a legislated obligation under the Australian Patents Act 1990
        (Federal Law Act) to maintain confidentiality of your idea.

        filed, the majority of new entrepreneurs start with a{' '}

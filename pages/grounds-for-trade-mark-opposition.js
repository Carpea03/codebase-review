      <h1>Grounds for opposing a trade mark application</h1>
      <p>
        In Australia, an <Link href="/trade-mark-opposition">opposition</Link>{' '}
        is known as the formal process of objecting to the registration of
        another mark. Once a trade mark application is{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-acceptance">accepted</Link> and advertised in
        the Official Journal of Trade Marks, any party can oppose the
        application under one or more grounds specified in the
        <em>Trade Marks Act (1995)</em> within 2 months of the advertisement
        date. The grounds for opposing a trade mark application that an opponent
        can rely on are explained below.

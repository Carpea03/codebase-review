      <p>
        A trade mark is an intellectual property right that protects a{' '}
        <Link href="/brand-name-vs-trade-mark">brand</Link>. These are the
        various types of trade marks that are used in the market.
      </p>
      <h2 id="word-marks">Word marks</h2>
      <p>
        These are trade marks that are composed entirely of alphanumeric text.
        This type of mark, which is set in plain block print, normally offers
        the broadest protections. While this type of mark has its advantages in
        relation to the protection it can provide, it is also normally harder to
        register. The main reason for this is that the scope of the alphanumeric
        text functioning as a badge of origin is not limited by any stylisation
        or graphical elements (such as a logo, font type or colour).
      </p>
      <h2 id="composite-logo">Composite or logo trade marks</h2>
      <p>
        This type of trade mark is different from word marks in that they can
        combine a number of branding elements, such as words that are stylised
        in a particular font, placement, and appearance and they can also
        include a logo, number or other graphical elements. This type of mark
        provides a narrower scope of protection than a word mark Businesses file
        composite or logo marks as an additional layer of protection to a word
        mark, or instead of a word mark, if it is unlikely the word mark would
        be registrable
      </p>
      <h2 id="series">Series trade marks</h2>
      <p>
        This type of trade mark includes a collection of trade marks with
        essentially the same concept or &quot;material particulars&quot;. Trade
        marks belonging to the series only vary in non-distinctive aspects, such
        as non-distinctive words or representations that denote (1) goods or
        services used in relation to the trade mark classes or (2) are
        indicative of orders (first, second, etc.), number, location, price,
        color, and quality. Series trade marks usually offer the advantage of
        reduced cost of filing, because one application can encompass every mark
        in the series as opposed to filing each trade mark separately. Marks
        such as this set of M&amp;Ms trade marks (AU TM#{' '}

        ) are some of the more familiar examples.
      </p>
      <h2 id="non-traditional">Non-traditional trade marks</h2>
      <p>
        These trade marks do not contain visual devices and words. Thus, a
        thorough description and/or a video file (in the case of movement trade
        marks) of these trade marks should be submitted to the trade mark office
        in case a graphical representation is not applicable. By definition, any
        of these aspects should solely perform a distinguishing function to be
        accepted as a trade mark. One challenge in registering these kinds of
        trade marks is providing evidence that the aspect does not function in
        any way other than distinguishing in relation to goods or services as
        reflected in the application.
      </p>
      <h3 id="sound">Sound trade mark</h3>
      <p>
        These may include music snippets, animal sounds, and other auditory
        impressions. Some of the most memorable sound trade marks include those
        of movie companies, such as MGM&apos;s lion roar and the orchestral
        theme for 20th Century Fox (AU TM #{' '}

        ).
      </p>
      <h3 id="movement">Movement trade mark</h3>
      <p>
        Application for trade mark registration requires a video clip of the
        motion to be submitted to the trade marks office. Example: the act of
        putting salt onto meat as popularized by Nusret Gökçe, also known as
        SaltBae (AU TM #{' '}

        ).
      </p>
      <h3 id="trade-dress">Trade dress</h3>
      <p>
        Trade dress refers to the packaging aspect trade mark, in which the
        identifiers are certain elements in the appearance of a product such
        that the consumer would not need a visible symbol or text for
        identification. These aspects must be both distinctive and
        non-functional. Several ubiquitous examples are the shape of a Coca Cola
        bottle (AU TM #{' '}

        ), which has been in use by the company since 1916, the Burberry tartan
        plaid (AU TM #{' '}

        ).
      </p>
      <h3 id="colour">Colour trade mark</h3>
      <p>
        This may refer to a single colour, but the capability of a single colour
        to distinguish a certain good or service from others may be difficult to
        prove; thus, colour trade marks are usually combined with different
        aspects, or a combination of colors and designs are used. One example is
        7-Eleven&apos;s three horizontal bands of orange, green, and red (AU TM
        #{' '}
        <Link
          href="https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/view/749403?q=749403"

          rel="noopener noreferrer">
          749403
        </Link>
        ). Colour trade marks may also be associated with trade dress, such as
        in the case of Carmex (AU TM #{' '}

        )
      </p>
      <h3 id="scent">Scent trade mark</h3>
      <p>
        An important feature of scent trade marks is its purely distinguishing
        function. For example, a flower scent to mask the smell of rubbing
        alcohol cannot be a scent trade mark. The use of Eucalyptus radiata
        scent for golf equipment (AU TM#{' '}
        <Link
          href="https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/view/1241420?q=1241420"

          rel="noopener noreferrer">
          1241420
        </Link>
        ) and Play-doh scent (US TM #{' '}
        <Link
          href="http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4801:on9o86.3.1"

          rel="noopener noreferrer">

        </Link>
        ) are examples of registered scent trade marks.
      </p>
      <h3 id="taste">Taste marks</h3>
      <p>
        In essence, it is extremely difficult for taste to serve as a trade mark
        because an impression of a product based on this aspect can only be
        experienced after purchase. At present, there are no registered taste
        trade marks in the Australian trade mark registry.
      </p>
      <h2>Trade mark type according to degree of distinctiveness</h2>
      <h3 id="generic">Generic &ldquo;trade marks&rdquo;</h3>
      <p>
        Generic &ldquo;marks&rdquo; are terms that denote an actual product.
        These marks cannot be registered and enforced because doing so will
        unfairly limit competition in the market. Thus, these types of trade
        marks should be avoided. In addition, extremely popular trade marks run
        the risk of becoming generic, which was the fate of marks like
        escalator, dry ice, and flip phone, among others.
      </p>
      <h3 id="descriptive">Descriptive trade marks</h3>
      <p>
        Merely descriptive marks are marks formed from words that identify one
        or more characteristics of the goods and/or services the mark claims
        protection for. In general, this type of mark may not be registered as a
        trade mark because it does not indicate the origin of a product or
        service and thus cannot distinguish them from the competition. For
        example, the word &ldquo;soft&rdquo; in relation to pillows or cotton
        and the word &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; in relation to knives do not confer any
        registrability. Descriptive marks can only be registered if they acquire
        a secondary meaning, which happens through prolonged, extensive use in
        commerce and through widespread advertising. For example:
        &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; has acquired a second meaning in relation to sharp
        edged, flat screen televisions. Surnames are treated as merely
        descriptive, meaning that the same criteria for the acceptance of
        descriptive marks apply.
      </p>
      <h3 id="suggestive">Suggestive trade marks</h3>
      <p>
        Suggestive marks are words or phrases that imply a feature of a product
        or service. Unlike merely descriptive marks, which directly refer or
        describe the goods/services, suggestive marks require a certain amount
        of imagination to arrive at, For example, the Coppertone brand suggests
        the outcome of using the line of suntanning products, and Citibank for
        financial services. One benefit of suggestive trade marks is that they
        give the consumers a clue regarding the nature of the product or service
        on offer. Suggestive marks can be inherently distinctive and can thus be

      <p>
        Arbitrary marks are words or phrases that are used as a badge of origin
        for goods or services that are totally unrelated to its usual meaning.
        The classic example is the mark &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; for computers.
        Arbitrary marks are innately distinctive and strongly registrable.

      <h3 id="fanciful">Fanciful trade marks</h3>
      <p>
        Among all trade mark types, fanciful trade marks possess the highest
        degree of distinctiveness because these words are previously
        non-existent and are coined for the sole purpose of branding. Archaic
        terms that are used out of their original context can also be considered
        as fanciful marks. Owing to the lack of prior association consumers will
        strongly associate that word with the particular product or service;
        however, this means increased marketing allocation for educating the
        public about your brand and its products or services. Several classic
        examples of fanciful trade marks include Kodak, Xerox and Pepsi.

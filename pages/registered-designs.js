      <h1>Registered designs</h1>
      <p>
        A registered design right provides legal protection for the visual
        appearance of a product.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I get a registered design on my product?</h2>

      <p>
        Yes &ndash; If your design is new and distinctive when compared with the{' '}
        <Link href="/ip-glossary#prior-art">prior art</Link>. The prior art
        includes designs publicly used in Australia, designs published in
        Australia or overseas and designs disclosed in earlier registrations.
      </p>

      <p>
        A registered design application must be made before any public product
        disclosure or commercial use of the product occurs, or else it will be
        invalid.
      </p>

      <h3>Why not use a patent or copyright to protect innovations?</h3>

      <p>
        A registered design does not normally provide protection for the
        function of an article; if functional protection is required, this can
        only normally be achieved using the{' '}
        <Link href="/how-to-patent">patent process</Link>. Conversely, a patent
        cannot protect innovations in the form of improvements to the
        non-functional appearance of a product; this can only be achieved using
        the registered design process. You can have both a registered design and
        a patent for the same product to protect designs in terms of all aspects
        (i.e. both the appearance and functionality).
      </p>

      <p>
        Copyright covers all 2-dimensional artistic works and some 3-dimensional
        artistic works. However, when 3-dimensional artistic works are used
        commercially (e.g. mass produced), they automatically lose copyright
        protection. In order to effectively prosecute a party who is using your
        commercial design, you need a registered design.
      </p>

      <h2>Benefits of a registered design</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Registered designs protect designs&apos; new and distinctive visual
          features against copying.
        </li>
        <li>
          Registered designs can also be used as a defensive measure to prevent
          a competitor from obtaining legal protection over the appearance of a
          product by them lodging their own registration. A registered design
          can provide this defensive position due to the publication of the
          design on registration by IP Australia. Once published, the registered
          design becomes prior art for any design application that is filed
          afterward &ndash; this publication is recognised worldwide, so a
          registered design in Australia will also prevent a competitor from
          obtaining a valid design registration for an item having the same or a
          similar appearance overseas.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The registered design process</h2>

      <p>
        You can register designs in Australia through a{' '}
        <Link href="/patent-attorney">patent attorney</Link> very quickly (often
        in a matter of a few weeks). Prior to filing a design application,
        black-and-white line drawings of the item showing its unique design from
        a variety of different aspects (e.g. front, side, top, perspective etc.
        &ndash; as many views as needed to show all the new and distinctive
        visual features of the design) need to be prepared. The representations
        are then filed at IP Australia along with details of the owner of the
        design and the author of the design.
      </p>

      <p>
        IP Australia then conducts a formalities examination only (no
        substantive examination of the newness or distinctiveness of the design
        is conducted prior to registration). If there are no formalities issues
        in the information supplied or in the representations of the design and
        the required official fees have been paid, IP Australia officially
        registers the design and publishes the details of the registration in
        the Australian Official Journal of Designs. Registration and publication
        in the Journal occur within a matter of weeks. Upon registration, the
        design is also made available to be searched by the general public in
        the Australian Designs Data Searching (ADDS) database.
      </p>

      <p>
        A design registration remains current for 5 years and then can be
        renewed once for a further 5-year period for a maximum term of 10 years.

      </figure>

      <h2>Enforcement of registered design</h2>

      <p>
        To obtain an enforceable design right, a Request for Certification of
        the registered design must be filed with IP Australia. At this time, IP
        Australia will conduct a substantive examination of the design to
        determine whether the design is new and distinctive over the prior art.
        Any person (not just the owner of the design) can file a request to have
        the registered design certified at any time during the term of the
        design.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the design passes this optional examination phase, noting that there
        is opportunity for your patent attorney to present counter arguments,
        the design is certified. Certified designs can be used to stop another
        party from selling products that are substantially similar in overall
        impression to the certified design.

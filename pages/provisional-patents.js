      <h1>Stage 1: Provisional Patent Applications</h1>

      <p>
        A provisional patent application has a life of 12 months and is designed
        to provide flexibility to an inventor insofar as the inventor may add
        undisclosed material to their provisional patent application at any time
        during its 12 month life. This is not possible with a standard patent
        application as will be discussed in more detail later. It is important
        to note that provisional patent applications are not available in all
        jurisdictions. However, Australia and the USA are two such countries
        which offer the beneficial option of an inventor filing a provisional
        application at the start of their patent journey.
      </p>

      <h2>Do I need a provisional application?</h2>

      <p>
        In the majority of cases, a provisional application is the best starting
        point in seeking patent protection and indeed most inventors file a
        provisional patent application initially.
      </p>

      <p>
        A provisional patent application provides the flexibility of the
        inventor being able to add new undisclosed material into the patent
        application at any time during the 12 month life of the patent
        application in the form of supplementary provisionals. This option is
        not available when filing a standard patent application and no new
        material can be added after filing if a standard patent application is
        filed.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have already disclosed your idea to the public prior to filing a
        patent application you may choose to file a complete patent application
        rather than a provisional patent application to take advantage of grace
        period countries. Grace period countries allow the inventor to file a
        patent application after a public disclosure as long as the inventor
        files a complete patent application within 12 months of that public
        disclosure. It is important to realise that you must file a complete
        patent application not a provisional patent application within 12 months
        of any public disclosure to take advantage of the grace period
        provisions for patents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Provisional applications also provide the added benefit of the inventor
        being able to request a novelty and inventiveness search known as an
        International Type Search (ITS), which may be requested up to ten months
        after filing the provisional patent application. The ITS provides
        invaluable information as to the likelihood that your patent application
        is likely to get granted at formal examination.
      </p>

      <h2>Applying for a Provisional and what to do after filing</h2>

      <p>
        There are a few things that you need to check before filing your
        provisional patent application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly, has the inventor disclosed the inventive idea to the public and
        if so was it more than 12 months ago? If the inventor has made a public
        disclosure of the invention more than 12 months ago, then unfortunately
        the inventors opportunity to obtain patent protection has closed. If the
        inventor has disclosed their invention to the public and it was less
        than 12 months ago, there may still be an opportunity to obtain patent
        protection in grace period countries. In this case, it may be more
        appropriate to file a standard patent application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly, does the inventor have sufficient information about the
        invention or is it merely a concept? Whether the patent application is a
        provisional or a standard application the legislation states that the
        patent application needs to disclose sufficient information so that a
        &ldquo;person skilled in the art&rdquo; can perform the invention. This
        standard requires that someone working in the field of the invention
        could reproduce the invention without undue experimentation by reading
        the patent application and referring to their common general knowledge.
        If this disclosure requirement has not been satisfied, the patent
        application may be rejected on those grounds, so it is important to
        ensure sufficient detail is provided in the patent application.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have not yet disclosed the invention to the public and the
        inventor has sufficient information relating to the invention to meet
        the disclosure requirements the inventor is in a position to file a
        provisional patent application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the provisional patent application has been filed, the next
        optional step would be to file a request for the patent office to
        perform a novelty and inventiveness search (ITS) on the provisional
        patent application. In this case, a fee is paid and a patent examiner
        with the Australian Patent Office performs a prior-art search and
        determines what if any of the claims are considered to be novel and
        involve an inventive step. This is typically performed around 2-3 months
        after the request for the ITS and can be requested soon after filing the
        provisional patent application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on the results of the ITS, the patentee may make amendments to the
        claims to avoid any prior art that may have been raised in the ITS,
        providing a solid strategy in obtaining patent protection.

        overview
      </h2>

      <p>
        Filing a US or Australian provisional patent application is normally the
        first stage in the patent application process in order to obtain patents
        around the world. An Australian provisional patent application is lodged
        by an{' '}

          title="Patent Attorneys Sydney &amp; Melbourne"
          href="/patent-attorney"

        </Link>{' '}
        at IP Australia and represents a cost-effective way to lay an
        international claim to your idea.
      </p>

      <h3>Priority date for provisional patent applications</h3>

      <p>
        The date on which a provisional patent application is received by IP
        Australia is known as its &ldquo;priority date&rdquo;. If, at a later
        point in time, you are granted a patent, you will be able to sue anyone
        who has infringed the patent after the priority date.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a provisional patent application has been filed by your patent
        attorney, you are free to disclose your new idea to interested parties,
        although we would recommend initially that you make such disclosures in
        confidence. Your new idea, whether product or software can then also be
        marked &ldquo;patent pending&rdquo;. By using a confidentiality
        agreement together with reference to your pending patent in meetings
        with third parties, the importance of confidentiality can be reinforced
        &ndash; if this is an aspect of your commercial strategy.
      </p>

      <h2>Misconceptions about provisional patent applications</h2>

      <p>
        There are a few notable misconceptions around the preparation of
        provisional patent applications and these include:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          That a provisional patent application does not need to be as detailed
          as a standard patent application.
        </li>
        <li>
          That a provisional patent application is a set scope of work that does
          not need to be defined.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Such misconceptions sometimes lead to inadequate provisional patent
        applications being filed, especially when not prepared by an{' '}

        are particularly cogent of the fact that the scope and detail of

        </Link>{' '}
        are often granted some 5 years after your provisional patent application
        is first filed. To explain the link between the two, we first need to
        understand in more detail how a provisional patent application works.
      </p>

      <h2>How does a provisional patent application work?</h2>

      <p>
        A provisional patent application is an invention specification lodged
        with IP Australia that, when set out properly by a patent attorney,
        includes both:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          A description of various examples (or &ldquo;embodiments&rdquo;) of
          your new idea or invention; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Claims, which are a series of legal definitions which become tests for
          infringement of your patent.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The way claims define the scope of a new idea or invention is by
        defining: (1) a broad notion of the new idea in what are called
        independent claims and by then defining (2) subsidiary, more detailed
        definitions of your new idea in what are known as dependent claims.
        Patent claims work like onion rings with the broadest independent
        claim(s) defining your optimal claim(s) to patent coverage (the outer
        layer) and the dependent claims defining contingency positions (the
        inner layers) that are used to circumvent prior art material (any
        information about the same idea that was publicly available at or before
        the priority date) during patent application examination processes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this way, a well-drafted provisional patent application prepared by
        an{' '}
        <Link
          title="Patent Attorneys Sydney &amp; Melbourne"
          href="/patent-attorney"
        >
          Australian patent attorney
        </Link>{' '}
        should establish a robust international filing date for your new idea.
      </p>

      <h2>Why are provisional patents so important?</h2>

      <h3>
        1. A thorough provisional patent application supports your patent
        priority claim
      </h3>

      <p>
        A provisional patent application establishes an international filing
        date for any new idea or invention properly articulated in your patent
        specification.{' '}
        <Link
          title="National Patent Applications"
          href="/national-phase-patent"
        >
          Stage 4 National Patent Applications
        </Link>{' '}
        that claim priority to this international filing date, in certain
        situations, are fully reliant on this priority claim to be valid. One
        such situation is where the new idea was publicly disclosed or other
        prior art become publicly available in the first 12 months post filing
        of the provisional patent application.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem is that this priority claim to the International filing date
        will only be upheld, where the full legal breadth of the claims were
        supported by adequately described embodiments of your new idea and this
        support was included in the patent specification of your provisional
        patent application.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        A thorough provisional patent application supports the priority claim to
        your earliest international filing date and hence, in some situations,
        can make the difference between a valid or an invalid patent.

      <h3>
        2. A thorough provisional patent application enhances your patent
        monopoly coverage
      </h3>

      <p>
        If an inadequate range of embodiments are provided in your patent
        specification, a patent office or court may interpret your claims more
        narrowly. Since embodiments are normally written into the{' '}
        <Link

        as a result of the detailed work originally performed on the provisional
        patent application and in any case, cannot be added post filing of your{' '}

        </Link>
        , it is very important that your provisional patent application is a
        detailed disclosure of your invention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where claims are interpreted more narrowly, the ability of your granted
        patent to capture an infringement (i.e. its legal effectiveness) is
        limited. Therefore, our{' '}

        always recommend you file a detailed provisional patent application from
        the outset with enough embodiments to support the full breadth of your
        claims.

        3. A thorough provisional patent application sets the ground work for
        patent examination
      </h3>

      <p>
        A provisional patent application filing is the first point at which the
        new idea is articulated in a scope-defined, legal manner in the claims.
        Whilst claims are normally reviewed and amended prior to filing your{' '}

        </Link>
        , the foundational wording of the claims is normally developed during
        the drafting of your provisional patent application. Further, since we
        know that claims define contingency positions during examination
        processes, the filing of a detailed provisional patent application with
        a well-articulated claim structure from the outset (i.e. a finely graded
        set of &ldquo;onion rings&rdquo;) helps achieve a successful result
        during examination of your patent application by creating better
        &ldquo;fall-back&rdquo; positions.

      <h2>
        Baxter IP&apos;s quiver of provisional patent application strategies
      </h2>

      <p>
        A thorough approach to patent drafting requires strategic insights, here
        are some of ours:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Identify the crux of the new idea:</strong>Protect the concept
          behind the new idea, not just specific implementations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Identify multiple inventions:</strong>Viewing the one product
          from different angles can often lead to being able to define multiple
          inventions. This can:
          <ul>
            <li>help protect future research and development</li>
            <li>create intellectual property asset value</li>
            <li>
              reduce the risk of invalidity of your patent application; and
            </li>
            <li>better capture arising infringement.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Brainstorm and then file again:</strong>Once your initial
          provisional patent application has been filed to establish an early
          filing date, meet with a group of creative and commercial employees
          together with your{' '}
          <Link

          >
            patent attorney
          </Link>{' '}
          to see if you can:
          <ul>
            <li>find ways to broaden your claims</li>
            <li>develop new embodiments of your idea</li>
            <li>
              define ideas in different ways in the claims to create new
              independent claim sets; and
            </li>
            <li>
              think how a competitor might replicate your new idea in a less
              preferable way but in such a way as to avoid infringement of your
              claims.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Focus patent protection on competitors, not consumers:
          </strong>
          It is important that patent claims be written correctly to ensure that
          competitors that will be producing the claimed apparatus, or carrying
          out the protected process, will be found to be infringing your patent
          &ndash; and not your customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Focus patent protection on commercial advantages:</strong>
          The wording of the claims should be broad enough to protect the
          commercial advantages of the idea, and not just the particular
          apparatus or software.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Patent protect the consumables:</strong>Where possible, it is
          important to patent protect not just the apparatus or process, but
          also consumables used in or with the apparatus or process. In this
          way, the important revenue streams can be protected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Targeting the arrow:</strong>In addition to protecting your
          new ideas, intellectual property protection can be targeted at
          hindering competitor product development by filing patents or{' '}

          around likely future versions of their product line.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protect products made by a process:</strong>Filing claims that
          patent protect products made by the inventive process can enhance
          protection in some markets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>File provisional patent applications often:</strong>
          Where development lifecycles extend over months or more, consult with
          your patent attorney regularly as to whether a further provisional
          patent application needs to be filed to cover new project or product
          developments.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The bottom line</h2>

      <p>Since, a thorough provisional patent application enhances:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>the validity of your patent</li>
        <li>your ability to enforce your patent; and</li>

          your ability to achieve a successful result during patent examination
        </li>

      <p>
        It is therefore highly beneficial to prepare and file a thorough
        provisional patent application that has:

          adjusting the wording in your claims accordingly.

      <h3>A supportive detailed description can be achieved by:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Capturing all embodiments thoroughly; and</li>

          Brainstorming variations and covering these in your description too.

      <h2>How much does a provisional patent application cost?</h2>

      <p>There is a fairly proportional link between:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          How well-developed a claim structure is and how supportive a detailed
          description is;
        </li>
        <li>
          The amount of professional time required to develop the patent
          specification; and
        </li>
        <li>Cost</li>
        <li>Chances of successful patenting</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts in preparing a thorough
        provisional patent application. When assessing the costs of different
        patent attorney firms, you should understand that the main cost of
        drafting and filing a provisional patent application lies in the
        professional time involved. So far as provisional patent applications
        are concerned: &ldquo;you get what you pay for&rdquo;. Given that the
        hourly rates of most patent attorneys (of similar experience) are
        relatively consistent, you might question why some are cheaper than
        others.

        Typically, quotations offered by different firms are for provisional
        patent applications that vary in terms of:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>The number of independent claims sets;</li>
        <li>The number of dependent claims in each independent claim set;</li>
        <li>The depth of coverage in the description of the invention;</li>
        <li>
          The number of embodiments of your invention that are fully described;
          and
        </li>
        <li>
          The inclusion or otherwise of brainstorming to broaden coverage.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>All of these 5 factors can affect the end outcome in terms of:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The validity of your patent;</li>
        <li>Your ability to enforce your patent; and</li>
        <li>Your ability to achieve a successful result during examination.</li>
      </ol>

        It is therefore important to strike the right balance between budgetary
        requirements and the effectiveness of your intellectual property rights.

      <h1>Domain names and trade marks</h1>
      <p>
        A domain name is an address made up of letters or a combination of
        letters and numbers, where internet users can access a business&apos;
        website. A domain name registration can also function as a trade mark by
        distinguishing the source of goods/services from other traders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of a domain name can be used to demonstrate{' '}
        <Link href="/first-to-file-vs-first-to-use">first use</Link> or prior
        use of a trade mark so as to establish a common law claim to ownership
        of the corresponding trade mark. A domain name however does not provide
        a right to register that name as a trade mark. Conversely, a business
        name, company name or a registered trade mark does not provide a
        priority right to a domain name over another trader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Registering a domain name does not give full rights to the name. Any
        party that registers a domain name does not own the name; the domain
        name can be used for a specified period according to certain terms and
        conditions. When filing a domain name request, the applicant
        automatically agrees to and is responsible for ensuring they are
        eligible to use the domain name.
      </p>
      <p>
        A trade mark is a sign or symbol that functions to distinguish the
        source of origin of one traders goods and services from another trader.
        A registered trade mark gives the owner exclusive rights under the{' '}
        <em>Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth)</em> to take an infringement action where
        an alleged infringer uses the mark as a trade mark which is:
      </p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          substantially identical, or deceptively similar, to the registered
          mark; and
        </li>
        <li>
          used upon or in relation to the same or{' '}
          <Link href="/classes-of-goods-and-services">
            closely related goods/services
          </Link>{' '}
          specified in the registered trade mark.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A domain name can be revoked in{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-infringement">trade mark infringement</Link>{' '}
        situations through the .au Dispute Resolution Policy. If the domain name
        is registered but is not used in the course of trade then an
        infringement of the trade mark is unlikely to be sustained. Conversely,
        You may not be able to stop another party from using your preferred
        domain name even if it is identical to your trade mark if the
        goods/services are not the same or closely related in a trade sense. In
        this latter context the trade mark owner can still sue under s 18 of the{' '}
        <em>Australian Consumer Law</em> for &lsquo;misleading and deceptive
        conduct&rsquo;. Further, in Common Law, the trade mark owner can sue for
        Passing Off as long as the trade mark has reputation, the website domain
        name misrepresented your trade mark, and you, as the trade mark owner,
        incurred damage.
      </p>
      <h2>.au Dispute Resolution Policy</h2>
      <p>
        The .au Dispute Resolution Policy is established by the .au Domain
        Administration for arbitrating cybersquatting cases involving .au
        domains. The policy provides a quicker, more economical route to
        litigation.

      <h3>auDRP &ndash; Elements of a Complaint</h3>
      <p>
        The auDRP is an administrative proceeding, and as a general guide, a
        complainant&apos;s grounds for disputation under the auDRP include the
        following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Respondent&apos;s domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a
          name, trade mark or service mark in which the complainant has rights;
        </li>
        <li>
          Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect to the
          domain name; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Respondent has registered or subsequently used the domain name in bad
          faith.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In the administrative proceeding, the complainant bears the onus of
        proof of the above grounds.
      </p>
      <h3>Comments on Elements for Claimant</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Respondent&apos;s domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a
          name, trade mark or service mark in which the complainant has rights
          <ul>
            <li>
              Generally, ownership of a registered Australian trade mark is
              sufficient to establish threshold requirement of the complainant
              having rights in a trade mark [

                  Panels have tended to take the view that a pending or even
                  accepted trade mark application, which has not proceeded to
                  registration, does not satisfy the requirement of the
                  complainant having rights [

              For unregistered trade marks, the complainant generally needs to
              establish it has an unregistered right in Australia;
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For unregistered trade mark rights to exist in Australia, the
                  complainant needs to have a reputation in Australia in respect
                  of the unregistered trade mark &ndash; this is usually
                  established by evidence of use in commerce such as sales and
                  revenue data in Australia [
                  <em>

              The test for identity is that there is &ldquo;essential or virtual
              identity&rdquo; between the domain name and the trade mark or name
              in which the complainant has rights.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The test for confusing similarity is typically undertaken by a
                  comparison of the domain name with the trade mark or name
                  alone, independent of the other marketing and use factors that
                  might be considered in a trade mark infringement or a
                  misleading and{' '}

                  conduct case. Application of the confusing similarity test
                  typically involves a straightforward visual or aural
                  comparison of the trade mark or name with the alphanumeric
                  string in the domain name, to determine the likelihood of
                  internet-user confusion. In order to satisfy the test for
                  confusing similarity, the relevant trade mark or name would
                  generally need to be recognisable as such within the domain
                  name. However, each case is judged on its own merits [

                  As figurative, stylised or design elements in a trade mark are
                  generally incapable of representation in a domain name, such
                  elements are typically disregarded for the purpose of
                  assessing the identity or confusing similarity of a domain

              A complainant is required to make out a <em>prima facie</em> case

              <em>prima facie</em> case is made, the burden of production shifts

              A respondent will be taken to have demonstrated rights or
              legitimate interests in a domain name where, before any notice of
              the subject matter of the dispute, it has <em>bona fide</em> used,
              or prepared to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to the

              The key issue is whether the respondent&apos;s use of the domain
              name is <em>bona fide</em> &ndash; i.e., is in good faith. To
              determine whether a respondent&apos;s use of a domain name is in
              good faith requires a consideration of the respondent&apos;s
              motivation for undertaking that use; which, in turn, requires an
              evaluation of all the facts and evidence. Relevant facts include:

              Evidence of the registration and use of the domain name in bad

              the respondent&apos;s likely knowledge from that evidence. Where

              or where there is evidence indicating that the respondent would
              reasonably have been aware of the trade mark or name (
              <em>e.g.</em>, where the complainant and respondent are
              competitors in the same industry, or where the respondent was

        <em>bona fide</em> offering of goods and services, and thus have a
        legitimate interest in the domain name, if its use meets certain
        requirements including: the respondent must actually be offering goods
        or services related to the trade mark in respect of which the domain
        name is confusingly similar;

        <li>
          the respondent must have disclosed its true relationship with the

        auDRP panels have tended to recognise that a respondent&apos;s
        registration of a trade mark corresponding to the disputed domain name
        will normally, but does not necessarily, establish that the respondent
        has rights or legitimate interests in that domain name [

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        To bring an auDRP action, the complainant first needs to establish a
        priority claim to ownership of a trade mark in Australia &ndash; a
        priority claim can be established by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Obtaining a registered trade mark which is identical or confusingly
          similar to the relevant domain name; or
        </li>
        <li>
          Where the complainant does not have a registered trade mark, the
          complainant needs to establish that it has an unregistered right in
          Australia
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For unregistered trade mark rights to exist in Australia, the
        complainant needs to have a reputation in Australia in respect of the
        unregistered trade mark &ndash; this is usually established by evidence
        of use in commerce such as sales and revenue data in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second aspect of bringing an auDRP action, is whether the
        respondent&apos;s use of the domain name is bona fide, i.e., is in good
        faith, needs to be established. This requires a consideration of the
        respondent&apos;s motivation for using the domain, which, in turn,
        requires an evaluation of all the facts and evidence. Relevant facts can
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the degree of similarity of the domain name to the complainant&apos;s
          mark; and
        </li>
        <li>
          the respondent&apos;s awareness of the complainant&apos;s business
          conducted under its mark and the likelihood of customer confusion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Another relevant consideration in an auDRP action is whether the
        respondent has a legitimate claim to ownership &ndash; for example, a
        reseller or distributor of a product (for example, &quot;imported from
        New Zealand&quot; marked with the trade mark). These parties can be
        making a bona fide offering of goods and services in Australia and thus
        have a legitimate interest in the domain name if their use meets certain
        requirements, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the respondent must actually be offering goods or services related to
          the trade mark in respect of which the domain name is confusingly
          similar;
        </li>
        <li>
          the respondent must offer only those goods or services in connection
          with the disputed domain name;
        </li>
        <li>
          the respondent must have disclosed its true relationship with the
          owner of the trade mark to which the domain name is identical or
          confusingly similar, prior to notice of the dispute; and
        </li>
        <li>
          the respondent must not have attempted to &quot;corner the
          market&quot; in domain names that reflect that trade mark.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Examples of cases involving domain names and trade marks</h3>
      <p>
        Generally, ownership of a registered Australian Trade Mark is sufficient
        to establish threshold requirement of the complainant having rights in a

        &gt;, marks that are in the intermediate stages in their timelines prior
        to registration are considered not to satisfy the requirement of the
        complainant&apos;s trade mark rights. For unregistered trade marks in
        Australia, the claimant needs to provide evidence of use in the market,
        such as sales and revenue figures.

        In <em>Sports Warehouse, Inc v Fry Consulting Pty Ltd</em>, one party
        used a registered trade mark as a domain name. Sports Warehouse has been
        in the tennis apparel and tennis gear business since 1994 and has made
        the majority of its sales through their website called{' '}

        </Link>
        . Sports Warehouse registered the mark TENNIS WAREHOUSE. Fry Consulting,
        a wholesaler and retailer of tennis apparel and tennis gear, runs most
        of its operations off of its website called{' '}

        </Link>
        . This website was established after Sports Warehouse&apos;s business
        had extended to Australia. In this case, it was concluded that the use
        of the domain name www.tennis-warehouse.com constituted use of the mark
        TENNIS WAREHOUSE, which did not affect the identity of the registered
        mark.

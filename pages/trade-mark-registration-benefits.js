      <h1>Benefits of a trade mark registration</h1>
      <p>
        When starting a business, the{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-registration-process">
          registration of your trade mark
        </Link>
        , logo and/or business name should be an important consideration. Trade
        mark registration provides important advantages over unregistered trade
        marks. Below are several benefits of a trade mark registration:
      </p>
      <h2>Intellectual property ownership</h2>
      <p>
        A registered trade mark grants the owner exclusive rights to use the
        trade mark as a badge of origin of the{' '}
        <Link href="/classes-of-goods-and-services">goods and services</Link> in
        respect of which the trade mark is registered. A trade mark is a form of
        personal property with a corresponding value. As the relevant product or
        service grows in recognition, so does the value of your trade mark.
      </p>
      <h2 id="#leveraging-trade-marks">
        Leveraging your registered trade mark
      </h2>
      <p>
        Trade marks are logos, words or other signs associated with{' '}
        <Link href="/choosing-a-brand-name">branding a business</Link> or its
        products or services. One benefit of trade mark registration is that it
        allows, like any tangible property, for trade mark ownership to be
        assigned.
      </p>
      <h3 id="#buying-selling-trade-marks">Buying and selling trade marks</h3>
      <p>
        A trade mark can be bought or sold through transfer of business
        ownership. The ownership of a trade mark can be transferred in the event
        of sale of a business as part of the inventory. The party to whom the
        trade mark will be transferred is called the assignee, and the ownership
        of the registered trade mark is transferred to the assignee by a trade
        mark assignment agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conditions under which the registered trade mark is purchased
        dictate the terms and obligations included in the assignment agreement.
        In the case that the assignee will not use the trade mark directly, a
        supplementary agreement is needed to ensure that the trade mark will not
        be subjected to non-use disputes or removal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Importantly, the transfer should be reflected on the trade marks
        registry, otherwise, the assignee may not be able to claim the benefits
        of trade mark ownership, such as initiating legal action against
        infringing parties.
      </p>
      <h3 id="#licensing-trade-marks">Licensing trade marks</h3>
      <p>
        Trade marks can also be licensed by a legal agreement that gives a third
        party the right to use the trade mark. For the licensor, licensing
        agreements can provide access to new and broader markets, distribution
        of workload and responsibilities, and partnerships. The licensee, in
        turn, is able to benefit from the goodwill and reputation that the trade
        mark has already gained in the market. For example, Subway, which is one
        of the world&apos;s largest single-brand restaurant chain franchises
        licenses its trade-mark to its franchisees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, as per the terms of a license agreement, the licensee must
        ensure that the quality of the goods or services associated with the
        trade mark remains unchanged and up-to-standard.
      </p>
      <h3 id="#valuing-trade-marks">Valuing trade marks</h3>
      <p>
        Several aspects should be considered in determining the value of a trade
        mark. A base consideration is the{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-pre-filing-considerations#costs">
          cost of applying for the trade mark
        </Link>{' '}
        and successfully registering it. The most important consideration is the
        investment made in establishing the brand. Market research can show how
        much others would be willing to pay for comparable products. The impact
        of the use of the trade mark in increasing sales is also a
        consideration.
      </p>
      <h2 id="#national-protection">National protection</h2>
      <p>
        A{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-application">
          registered Australian trade mark
        </Link>{' '}
        is enforceable throughout Australia. The trade mark owner is
        advantageously positioned to stop another party from unauthorised use of
        the trade mark in relation to the goods and services in respect of which
        the trade mark is registered. Registration means that the{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-pre-filing-considerations#owner">
          owner of the trade mark
        </Link>{' '}
        does not have to provide proof of business reputation of the owner or
        deception by the infringing party. In addition, the trade mark owner can
        have the Australian Customs Service issue a seizure notice to the
        infringing party. Enforcement of trade mark rights can be carried out in
        the Federal Circuit Court or the Federal Court.
      </p>
      <h2 id="#labels">Label</h2>
      <p>
        In Australia, registration means that the trade mark can be marked ®,
        meaning registered, as opposed to ™, which is used to indicate that the
        trade mark is claimed but not necessarily registered. The ® label can
        also be effective as a deterrent to other parties who may be considering
        using a similar trade mark.
      </p>
      <h3 id="#registered-trade-marks">Registered trade marks</h3>
      <p>
        As defined by <em>Section 17 of the Trade Marks Act</em>,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        a trade-mark is a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish
        goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a
        person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other
        person.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        A trade mark is a sign consisting of text, logo, slogan, color, sound,
        movement, other elements or a combination of any of those that is used
        to trace back a product or a service to its source. To obtain a
        registered trade mark, the owner has to lodge an{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-application">application</Link> to the trade
        mark office of the pertinent jurisdiction; after a certain{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-examination">examination</Link> period, the
        trade mark is accepted and{' '}
        <Link href="/publication-of-trade-mark-details">published</Link> in the
        official trade mark registry for the public, heralding a period during
        which any third party can{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-opposition">oppose the registration</Link>. If
        the said opposition was proven to be without merit, then the trade mark
        would proceed to registration. Upon registration, a registered trade
        mark is retroactively enforced to its priority date and{' '}
        <Link href="/trade-mark-renewal">renewable</Link> every 10 years with
        the payment of the appropriate fees. In Australia, the enforcement of
        registered trade marks is governed by the <em>Trade Marks Act 1995</em>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="#unregistered-trade-marks">Unregistered trade mark</h3>
      <p>
        An unregistered trade mark, also known as common law trade mark, is
        similarly a brand made up of the same elements as in the above
        definition. This mark is also used to trace back the goods and services
        to its source; however, this type of mark is not provided any statutory
        protection by the <em>Trade Marks Act 1995</em>. Instead, the avenues of
        relief for common law trade marks are strongly reliant on the reputation
        developed by the mark through consistent use, as well as proof of
        fraudulent conduct on the part of the offending party. An unregistered
        trade mark can be enforced through the common law tort of &ldquo;passing
        off&rdquo; and deceptive conduct as stated in the Australian Consumer
        Law. To enforce an unregistered trade mark, three things need to be
        established:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          That the trade mark has acquired considerable reputation in the
          market;
        </li>
        <li>
          That the offending party deliberately sought to mislead customers
          regarding the origin of their goods or services
        </li>
        <li>
          That the owner of the unregistered mark has sustained damages and
          losses because of the action of the offending party.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="#trade-mark-vs-registered">TM vs ®</h3>
      <p>
        The sign ™ is affixed to show the market that a particular trade mark
        has been claimed. Any trade mark owner can use the ™ sign, whether they
        applied for trade mark registration or not. In itself, the ™ sign offers
        no protection, but it may act as a deterrent for parties who may
        consider filing a registration for a similar trade mark because the sign
        may imply a pending trade mark application. When the trade mark is
        registered, the sign ® is affixed to the trade mark, indicating that
        trade mark protection is in force. The use of ® on unregistered trade
        marks is illegal.

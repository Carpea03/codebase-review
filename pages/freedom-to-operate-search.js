      <h1>Freedom-to-operate patent search</h1>
      <h3>Why carry out a freedom-to-operate patent search</h3>
      <p>
        If you are looking to develop or release a new product, it is important
        to ascertain whether it would be open to a claim for infringement of
        intellectual property rights of a third party, for example, third-party
        patent rights. If the answer to this question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, then
        you are said to have &ldquo;freedom-to-operate&rdquo;. A
        freedom-to-operate patent search is also known as a &ldquo;patent
        clearance search&rdquo; or a &ldquo;
        <Link href="/ip-glossary#infringement">patent infringement</Link>{' '}
        search&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        A freedom-to-operate patent search addresses the risk associated with
        being blocked from market by a third party in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>development costs</li>
        <li>reputational damage</li>
        <li>withdrawal of products or services from the market</li>
        <li>legal costs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our clients who operate in crowded markets routinely have us carry out
        patent clearance searches. The first step in an Australian
        freedom-to-operate patent search is to identify granted Australian
        patents or <Link href="/provisional-patents">patent applications</Link>{' '}
        (which would upon grant) that are live and that pose an infringement
        risk. Your product or proposed product is then analysed against the
        claims of the patents that have been identified by the patent clearance
        search.
      </p>
      <h2>How to achieve freedom-to-operate</h2>
      <p>
        When a third-party files a portfolio of patent applications, they
        generally will only file in a small selection of countries. For example,
        a patent applicant may only file a{' '}
        <Link href="/provisional-patents">patent application</Link> in the
        United States and Europe &ndash; and not in Australia, in which case you
        can make and sell their patented invention in Australia and in every
        country other than the United States and Europe. The third-party patent
        application may have also been &ldquo;knocked back&rdquo; or limited
        during examination in some countries, and you may therefore still have
        freedom-to-operate in those countries.
      </p>
      <h2>What to do if you don&apos;t have freedom-to-operate</h2>
      <p>
        If you had a freedom-to-operate patent search carried out and discovered
        that you would infringe an existing patent if you were to proceed with
        your product, it&apos;s not the end of the road. There are at least 4
        paths you can go down:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You can attempt to invalidate the patent by locating{' '}
          <Link href="/ip-glossary#prior-art">prior art</Link>. Sometimes,
          patent examiners miss important items of prior art that either alone,
          or in combination with other prior art documents, would invalidate or
          limit the claims of the granted patent. Furthermore, patent examiners
          will normally only look at patents and scientific publications and not
          more broadly at the prior art base, such as on commercial websites,
          forums or blogs. Patent examiners also easily miss prior art documents
          that are not in English &ndash; for example, those on the Russian
          Patent Office Database.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can attempt to obtain a license for the technology from the patent
          owner. You will most likely be successful in obtaining a license where
          the patent owners themselves have not commercialised a product in
          accordance with the patent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where you are the owner of a{' '}
          <Link href="/provisional-patents">patent application</Link> that is of
          interest to the patent owner of the third-party patent, there is also
          the possibility of cross-licensing the two patent applications. This
          has become quite a popular solution employed by large companies to
          avoid <Link href="/patent-litigation">patent litigation</Link>, but
          this approach is useful for all companies.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can attempt to design around the patent, that is, to ensure that
          your product design does not encompass all of the features of one of
          the claims of the third-party patent. Your{' '}
          <Link href="/patent-attorney">patent attorney</Link> can help you with
          designing around an existing patent.

                Patent benefits

      <h1>Benefits of a patent</h1>
      <p>
        The patent system is designed to stimulate invention by providing
        inventors with a monopoly to develop and commercialise their invention.
        Applying for a patent can be a fairly lengthy process but there are many
        benefits associated with filing a patent. In order for a patent to be
        granted, the invention has to be novel and involve an inventive step.
      </p>
      <p>There are several benefits in patenting an invention, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          gaining a monopoly to commercialise and develop an invention. Patent
          protection can last up to 20 years (25 years for pharmaceuticals);
        </li>
        <li>lawfully restricting competition;</li>
        <li>
          potential tax benefits (e.g. for health care inventions in Australia);
        </li>
        <li>
          creating/obtaining an intangible asset that can be used to increase
          credibility, attract investors and funding; and
        </li>
        <li>
          the ability to generate income through licensing the invention
          (including internationally).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Patent assets generate income and protect profit</h2>
      <p>
        A patent is an asset which adds value to a company. It can be sold,
        transferred, licensed and used as collateral to obtain finance. A patent
        in and of itself does not generate income, revenue is generated via
        commercialisation of the product and/or licensing fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        A well drafted patent can provide the inventor with a head start to
        commercialise the invention and restrict competition, allowing the
        inventor to charge and control its market driven process rather than
        being subject to competitor driven prices. If a new product is
        introduced to the market and becomes highly commercialised, it is often
        reverse engineered or copied by competitors. This often allows the
        competitors to sell the same or similar product at a lower price as they
        did not have to bear the original costs associated with research and
        development. If the invention is not protected, the originator will have
        to rely on its brand name or reduce its prices to remain competitive. If
        patent protection has been obtained, the originator will be able to
        issue a cease and desist letter to the competitors. Legal proceedings
        can also be commenced, if necessary, to enforce the patent, restrict
        competition and obtain damages where applicable (these include
        reputational damage and loss of profits).
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to restrict competition and have protection for up to 20
        years allows inventors to patent inventions that may not yet be fully
        developed. It also allows concepts that may not yet be commercially
        viable to be protected for future commercialisation. Concepts that may
        currently appear to be futuristic or have no current commercial value
        may become very valuable in the course of the 20 years of protection
        provided by a patent.
      </p>
      <h2>Patent tax breaks</h2>

      <p>
        Certain inventions in the healthcare domain may also attract tax
        benefits. The Australian Government is introducing a “patent box” system
        where IP derived income will be taxed at a much lower rate of 17% for
        inventions in the medical device and biotechnology spaces.
      </p>
      <h2>Patents are better than confidentiality agreements</h2>
      <p>
        Once a patent application has been filed, the invention can be disclosed
        to potential investors, collaborators and granting bodies without having
        to rely on the use of confidentiality agreements. There are many
        pitfalls in relying on confidentiality agreements to protect an
        invention, these include difficulties in enforcing the agreement,
        difficulties in quantifying and calculating remedies for breach and the
        irreversible damage of losing the ability to obtain patent protection
        due to prior disclosure.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting started with patenting</h2>
      <p>
        There have been cases where inventors have disclosed their invention
        more than 12 months before filing (in conference proceedings, in tender
        applications and the like) and were therefore not able to apply for a
        patent. It is important to note that Australia (like most jurisdictions)
        is a “first to file”, and not a “first to invent” jurisdiction. If two
        inventors are working on a similar invention in parallel, the first to
        file will be granted the patent (assuming all other requirements are
        met) and the other inventor will then have no rights to commercialise
        the invention. It is therefore extremely important that inventors seek
        advice on the protection of their invention at a very early stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Australia, it is also possible to file for a provisional patent which
        gives inventors 12 months to decide whether to file a full patent
        application. The filing of a provisional patent establishes an
        internationally recognised priority date and gives an inventor time to
        decide whether the invention is worth patenting. It also allows
        disclosure of the invention for commercialisation and investment
        purposes without needing to rely on a confidentiality agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key takeaway message is to contact a qualified patent attorney to
        get advice on how to protect your invention from the early stages. A
        successful patenting strategy involves deciding in which jurisdiction to
        file, drafting the claims in the patent appropriately so it has less
        chance of being contested and managing any identified competitor
        infringements. The ability to enforce a patent and restrict competition
        depends on the drafting of the claims in the patent application and the
        scope of the invention. It is, thus, vitally important to consult a
        professional patent attorney who can ensure that the claims are drafted
        to provide maximum protection and are yet not so broad that the
        requirements of examination cannot be met. Baxter IP has the skill and
        expertise required to advise you on every step of your patenting
        journey.

        'We were delighted to welcome Qi to the Baxter IP team in 2016. Specialising in <a href="/specialisations/software-patents" style="color:#7D67D8;"  className="links" >mobile communications</a>, <a href="/specialisations/electrical-engineering-patents" style="color:#7D67D8;"  className="links" >electrical engineering</a> and <a href="/specialisations/mechanical-patents" style="color:#7D67D8;"  className="links" >mechanics</a>, he works with private inventors, start-ups and SMEs, helping to identify and protect their IP assets and providing comprehensive support from concept through to commercialisation.\n\n' +
        'Qi provides clear, practical advice to clients on the patentability of their inventions and patenting strategies, in light of their specific goals and business strategies. He also drafts patent specifications and prosecutes patent applications in major jurisdictions, including Australia, US, China, Europe, Japan, Korea and other emerging economies.\n\n' +
        'Our clients appreciate Qi for his straightforward, jargon-free advice and for his strong focus on helping them to generate sustainable value from their ideas and hard work. Qi helps his clients explore different ideas and options, and make informed decisions about a patent strategy and commercialisation pathway to suit their individual circumstances and goals.\n\n' +
        'Prior to joining Baxter IP, Qi has enjoyed a highly successful international career in IP protection and management. In 2012 he was invited to join a tier-1 patent attorney firm in Sydney, where he qualified as an Australian patent attorney. Working with high-profile international clients and leading Australian research organisations, including NICTA, CSIRO and the University of Sydney, he provided expert advice on global patent strategies, drafted patent specifications, and provided legal and technical analyses of patentability in multiple technical areas including <a href="/specialisations/software-patents" style="color:#7D67D8;"  className="links" >software</a>, business methods, <a href="/specialisations/fintech-patents" style="color:#7D67D8;"  className="links" >financial services</a>, electronics, and mechatronics.\n\n' +
        'Before his move to Sydney Qi’s career took him to the USA, where he furthered his education in the IP field by completing a Master degree in Intellectual Property Management & Markets. As a patent researcher with a US patent consulting firm, he applied these learnings to help clients create tangible commercial value from their intangible IP assets – identifying valuable patents in hot consumer markets and advising clients on building their patent portfolios. His work also included identifying potential patent infringements and supporting clients through infringement litigation.\n\n' +
        'The foundations of Qi’s intellectual property career were built in China, where he worked with one of the top patent attorney firms in China after completing his Ph.D in electrical engineering in 2005. His work there included providing legal and technical advice, and managing the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications for major international clients including Motorola, Samsung, 3M, GE and Yamaha.',

      description:
        'When you’ve excelled in a particular field for 30 years, you build a name for yourself. When that area of excellence is mastering a scientific approach to <a href="/ip-strategy" style="color:#7D67D8;"  className="links" >IP strategy</a>, you also earn the admiration of both colleagues and clients. But for Warren Chandler, it’s only ever been about creating strong intellectual property assets for his clients.\n\n' +
        'The claim ‘attention to detail’ tends to be used far too liberally – but Warren’s appetite for detail can be seen in his comprehensive assessments of client’s commercial IP strategies, and it’s something that delivers literal and measurable results. Several Australian companies that Warren has advised from start-up stage have now emerged as large, well-known commercial enterprises with strong intellectual property assets. This is where Warren, and by extension, his clients are well served by his 24 years’ experience as a patent attorney in <a href="/specialisations/pharmaceutical-patents" style="color:#7D67D8;"  className="links" >chemical engineering</a>.\n\n' +
        'Warren worked across a broad spectrum of disciplines during the course of a 7-year tenure at the <a href="https://www.csiro.au/" style="color:#7D67D8;"  className="links"   className="links" targer="_black">CSIRO</a>. Fields as diverse as radical polymerisation of diallylamine monomers (at the division of applied organic chemistry) to chemical engineering, and controlled release of <a href="/specialisations/pharmaceutical-patents" style="color:#7D67D8;"  className="links" >veterinary pharmaceuticals</a> (at the division of Animal Production) were traversed during this time. With the dawn of the 90s, Warren registered as a patent attorney, commencing in his area of speciality, applied chemistry and methods of treatment of diseased states in animals and humans.\n\n' +
        'Warren’s modus operandum has always put client service and quality first. Warren’s reward? The satisfaction of a raft of listed and private companies whose businesses have significantly increased in value as a result of his assistance as their patent attorney.\n\n' +
        'A patient man, known for his tenacity, Warren has never lost a staring competition with his home-brewed beer and produces a brave if not aggressive drop for the private collection.',
